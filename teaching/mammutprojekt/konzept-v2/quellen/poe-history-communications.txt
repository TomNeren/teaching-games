a history of communications
A History of Communications advances a new theory of media that explains
the origins and impact of different forms of communication – speech, writing,
print, electronic devices, and the Internet – on human history in the long term.
New types of media are “pulled” into widespread use by broad historical trends,
and, once in widespread use, these media “push” social institutions and beliefs in
predictable directions. This view allows us to see for the ﬁrst time what is truly
new about the Internet, what is not, and where it is taking us.

I suppose it would be fair to say that I began writing this book in 1989,
when I had the good fortune of working for Professor Albert Lord just
before his death. Professor Lord, together with his colleague, Professor Milman Parry, had, many decades earlier, revolutionized Classical
scholarship by proposing that “Homer” was not a writer, but an oral
tradition. In a series of landmark studies, Professors Lord and Parry
showed that the traces of oral composition – in this case, singing –
could be seen in the texts of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Honestly, it was
all lost on me. I was just there to keep Professor Lord’s ofﬁce uncluttered and sort his mail. Since his ofﬁce was already uncluttered and he
sorted his own mail, I was often left with free time. I used it to look
through Professor Lord’s library. In it, I found several books devoted
to the study of the media and their effects by Marshall McLuhan, Jack
Goody, and others. Having nothing better to do except work on my
dissertation, I read them and was rather taken away. These early communications theorists made all kinds of fascinating claims about the
impact of the media on, well, everything. I didn’t know whether they
were right or not, but I decided I could use their sexy ideas to make my
own pedestrian research seem “theoretically informed,” which, to that
point, it was not. The result was a series of articles that, thankfully,
have passed from obscurity into still deeper obscurity.
Thereafter, I thought nothing of the media until, by another lucky
stroke, I landed a job in it at The Atlantic Monthly in 2002. I was part of
a small team that the owner of the magazine, David Bradley, had given
the humble task of preparing the storied magazine for the twenty-ﬁrst
century. You will not be surprised to learn that the thing principally
on our minds was the Internet and the question principally on our
ix

PREFACE

lips was “What will it do?” I was immediately reminded of my lazy
days in Professor Lord’s well-kept ofﬁce and the reading I had done
there. Upon quick review, I concluded that the early media theorists
had left me – or rather us – singularly unprepared to understand the
Internet. What wisdom did they have to impart about, say, the birth
and explosion of Wikipedia? None that I could see. More recent media
theorists proposed that the Internet was incomprehensible by the lights
of older theories because it was new. They said that we had never seen
anything like the Internet in world history, that it “broke all the rules.”
I suspected that these theorists didn’t know very much about world
history or the supposedly shattered rules. With this in mind, I began to
try to understand the Internet historically; not as something brand new,
but as the most recent iteration of something very old – the appearance
of a new medium. It had, after all, happened before. First we spoke.
Then we wrote. Then we printed. Then we listened to the radio and
watched TV. And now we surf the Internet. Each of these media was
different from the others, but all of them were of a piece – tools that
we used to send, receive, store, and retrieve messages. The Internet, it
seemed to me, was not so much brand new as a variation on an ancient
theme.
The book before you is the result of my attempt to discover the ways
in which that theme has varied with successive media technologies.
Whether I’ve hit the mark is for the reader to judge. My only hope is
that Professor Lord would smile on my effort to understand something
that was so close to his heart for so long.

INTRODUCTION

media causes and media
effects

The premises with which we begin are not arbitrary ones, not dogmas, but real
premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. They
are the real individuals, their activity and the material circumstances in which
they live, both those which they ﬁnd and those produced by their activity. These
premises can thus be veriﬁed in a purely empirical way.
– Karl Marx, The German Ideology, 18451

In 1846, Karl Marx surveyed the philosophical scene in Germany. He
was not happy with what he saw. The thinkers of his day, he complained, had mistaken speculative philosophy for hard science. They
loved to play with ideas, but they never quite got around to testing
them in the real world. The result was a thick bramble of vague concepts, imprecise notions, and fuzzy impressions that, while perhaps
entertaining, never really added up to a concrete theory of anything.
Marx thought these philosophers were doing their countrymen a disservice. Things were changing rapidly, and people needed to understand
why. He therefore set about trying to explain these ongoing changes by
means of a rigorous, empirically testable theory of history.
A similar situation obtains today in communications studies. The
most inﬂuential thinkers in the ﬁeld are, like the philosophers of Marx’s
day, a bit too fond of high-ﬂown ideas and not fond enough of the
solid facts. They propose theories that are at once hard to understand,
difﬁcult to test, and sometimes just plain wrong. These deﬁciencies are
unfortunate because, as in Marx’s era, things are changing rapidly.
In the last quarter century, we have witnessed a rare event in human
history: the birth of a new medium, the Internet. Although pundits tend
to exaggerate its impact, it is certain that that impact is signiﬁcant. The
1

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

Internet has changed the way we work, what we consume, how we
play, whom we interact with, how we ﬁnd things out, and myriad
other details about the way we live. Yet we don’t have a good way to
understand where the Internet came from and what it is doing to us, so
we are to some degree adrift.
This book is intended to help us ﬁnd our way by means of two
theories about the media in general and the Internet in particular. The
ﬁrst endeavors to explain why successive media – speech, writing, print,
audiovisual devices, and the Internet – arose when and where they did.
The second endeavors to explain what these media did and are doing to
the way we organize ourselves and what we believe. In this introductory
chapter, we will begin by discussing existing theories of media causes
and effects, all of which, save one, are deﬁcient. We will then turn to the
single exception, the theory of media genesis and effects propounded by
Harold Innis. Finally, building upon Innis’s ideas, we will lay out the
theories that form the backbone of this book.

marshall m c luhan
Any discussion of media theory must begin with Marshall McLuhan,
if only because he coined its most famous expression – “the medium
is the message.” Everyone knows this cliché, everyone repeats it, but,
alas, few agree on what it means or whether it’s true. The same might
be said of McLuhan’s writings generally: they are widely known, they
are widely read, yet they provoke as much head-scratching as comprehension. By all accounts, McLuhan was an adventurous, inventive, and
imaginative thinker, but he didn’t write very clearly. Here he is, for
example, explaining “the medium is the message” in 1964.
In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as
a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in
operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. This is merely to
say that the personal and social consequences of any medium – that is, of any
extension of ourselves – result from the new scale that is introduced into our
affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology.2

How should we understand this crucial passage? With a bit of effort,
we can ﬁnd the central hypothesis of all media studies – that media do
something to us. Here McLuhan says they have “personal and social
2

INTRODUCTION

consequences,” a promising start. You might think that the next sentence – or at least one nearby – would be something like “and those
consequences are . . . ,” followed by a series of empirical claims. This
medium does this, this medium does that, and this medium does the
other thing. If you had such an expectation, you would be disappointed.
Reading on, however, you would encounter random nuggets like “An
abstract painting represents direct manifestation of creative thought
processes as they might appear in computer design,” and “Alexis de
Tocqueville was the ﬁrst to master the grammar of print and typography.”3 Yet, search as you might, you will ﬁnd no clear, well-articulated
theory linking speciﬁc causes – kinds of media – with speciﬁc effects –
“personal and social consequences.” Perhaps such a theory could be
constructed out of carefully selected passages in McLuhan’s oeuvre, but
it would be a bit of a Frankenstein’s monster – an unholy composite of
parts never intended by their maker to be united in one being.
McLuhan, then, was not really a theorist in any straightforward,
empirical sense. Nonetheless, we should recognize that he made a crucial
contribution to media studies and therefore our project: he focused
scholarly attention on the media themselves – talking, writing, printing,
electronic signals – as opposed to the information the media convey.
He separated the medium from the message and, in so doing, founded
the central program of modern media studies, that which attempts to
describe and explain the effects of media on the human mind and human
groups. Nearly all researchers in media studies pursue some version
of this program today. A number of reasonably coherent “schools,”
however, stand out: the Mentalist, the Marxist, and the Matrixist.

the mentalists, the marxists, and the matrixists
The Mentalists – Walter Ong, Eric Havelock, and Jack Goody being the
best-known among them – are united in the conviction that media in
general and literacy in particular make people think differently.4 Learning to read and write, they propose, rewires the brain and enables new
cognitive abilities. This was and remains a sensible, sexy hypothesis.
We know that the brain undergoes radical changes during maturation,
and as it does, new mental capacities emerge. Children can’t talk and
then they can. They can’t reason and then they can. They can’t do arithmetic and then they can. Learning to read and write – and by extension
3

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

learning to use any other medium – must do something to our minds.
It’s true, it must. The difﬁculty is discovering just what that may be. If
media are the cause, then what are the cognitive effects? The answer
would seem to be simple enough: new modes of thought. But what are
these “modes of thought”? How many are there? And what exactly
differentiates them? The Mentalists often answer this question by positing dichotomies: “civilized” versus “savage” thought, “rational” versus
“irrational” thought, “logical” versus “illogical” thought. These dualities are not very speciﬁc, but they do have the virtue of being real
and therefore observable. Take the last of them, logical versus illogical.
There is indeed something very speciﬁc called “logic”; it is used by the
human mind to think; and it is unevenly distributed among humans –
some people reason logically and some don’t.
Logic, then, presents a clear test of the Mentalists’ thesis that media
change the way people think. If literacy causes logic, then the Mentalists
are right; if not, they are wrong, at least as far as the impact of literacy
is concerned. Careful anthropologists have run this test in the ﬁeld and
the results are deﬁnitive: there is no direct, causal relationship between
learning to read and write and the cognitive capacity to think logically.5
Teaching people to read and write has a signiﬁcant impact on their
ability to read and write, but not necessarily on their ability to reason.
This result, of course, doesn’t mean the Mentalists are incorrect on
all counts. We may yet ﬁnd ways in which media mold the mind. At
present, however, we don’t know of any.
While the Mentalists pursue the cognitive side of McLuhan’s program, the Marxists and their modern followers, the Critical Theorists,
investigate the macro-political side. The founders of this line of inquiry –
Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse6 – were practitioners of “media studies” avant le lettre and avant McLuhan. They
were interested in a lot of different things, but one of their central
concerns was to explain the persistence of capitalism long after Marx
predicted it would collapse. Their disciples are still mining this vein.7
The marxisant Critical Theorists are much less focused, though it would
be fair to say that they are concerned with comprehending the way capitalist mass media engender and maintain various forms of illusion,
alienation, and oppression.8 The idea of a “Culture Industry” is central to the Marxists and Critical Theorists. Simply stated, the Culture
Industry thesis holds that the late capitalist mass media turn people into
4

INTRODUCTION

obedient consumers, making them willing victims of exploitation, and
thereby ensuring the survival of capitalism itself. In Marx’s day, religion was the opiate of the masses; in our day, the Marxists and Critical
Theorists claim, it’s the mass media.
Like the Mentalists’ literacy thesis, the Culture Industry thesis has
the cardinal virtue of being testable. If we ﬁnd that the presence of mass
media hinders the development of socialist (or, generally, noncapitalist)
institutions, then they are right; if not, they are wrong. Over the past
half century this test has been run all over the world, and again the
results are unmistakable: the presence of mass media has no discernable
impact on the likelihood that a region will drift to the left. After World
War II, Western Europe evolved a sort of free-market socialism; the
United States did not. Since both had robust Culture Industries, we
can conclude that the mass media had no determinative effect.9 The
Marxists and Critical Theorists are certainly correct that the media
affect society. It’s just that their theory is unable to describe or explain
those effects.
The third school might be called “Postmodernist” or “Poststructuralist,” but those tags are too broad. A more telegraphic tag would
be the “Matrixist School,” after the popular 1999 science ﬁction ﬁlm
The Matrix. The ﬁlm portrays a universe comprised of a real part (the
earth) and a computer-simulated part (the Matrix). Humans actually
exist in the real part in life-support pods. They, however, don’t know
this. As far as they’re concerned they live in a modern city circa 2000.
But their city is only a very sophisticated representation. In short, the
“residents” of the Matrix are brains in vats. The writings of Jean Baudrillard in some measure inspired the ﬁlm.10 In essence, Baudrillard
argues that modern media have produced something like the Matrix.11
Thanks to mass communications, Baudrillard says, we no longer live in
a real world where representations refer to realities. Rather, we live in
a media-created world where representations only refer to other representations. Of course, like the people in the ﬁctional Matrix, we don’t
realize we are brains in vats. Thus, Baudrillard overturns McLuhan:
the medium is no longer the message, but instead the technology that
obscures all real messages.
It’s hard to know what to make of Baudrillard’s theory. It rests on a
solid empirical foundation: people are sometimes fooled into thinking
that representations are real. But, like the Marxists, the Matrixists seem
5

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

to go too far.12 Media are powerful, but they are not all-powerful. Most
people have no difﬁculty distinguishing reality from representation, even
when the latter is presented by fancy modern devices. Is there anyone
who thinks that “Reality TV,” for example, is reality in the full-blooded
sense? Moreover, most people realize that the media can be used to trick
them. Everyone knows not to “believe the hype” produced by the media.
Hollywood is the “Dream Factory,” not the “Reality Factory.” The key
question, empirically speaking, is this: How effective are different media
qua media at deceiving people, or rather, at prompting them to confuse
representation and reality? The Matrixists never pose this question, so
they never answer it.

harold innis
McLuhan pointed media studies in the right direction by telling us
that media themselves – not the information they convey – do something to us, but he refused to be speciﬁc. The Mentalist, Marxist, and
Matrix schools are speciﬁc, but their theories are empirically unsatisfying. If we desire a convincing theory of media effects, one that
will explain the impact of media generally, then we will have to look
elsewhere.
Fortunately, there is someplace promising to look, namely, to the
neglected work of Harold Allen Innis. Innis was a peculiar ﬁgure.13 He
worked as an economic historian at the University of Toronto, where
McLuhan was a student and later a professor. All of his early writings
suggest a cast of mind that was profoundly different from McLuhan’s.
The titles of Innis’s early monographs tell us much of the man: A History of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railroad (1923), Fur Trade in Canada: An
Introduction to Canadian Economic History (1930), Cod Fisheries: The
History of an International Economy (1940).14 These works were exercises in economic empiricism, not abstract engagements in high-ﬂying
theory. Believe it or not, they turned Innis into an academic celebrity.
He was perhaps the most respected scholar in Canada in the prewar
years, the celebrated founder of what is still known as the “Staples
Theory” of Canadian economic development. In the early 1940s, Innis
began – predictably enough – to study another staple of the Canadian
economy, pulp and paper. This research, however, led him in a new
and unforeseen direction.
6

INTRODUCTION

Although all of Innis’s writing had focused on Canadian economic
history, he was an admirer of grand historical thinkers such as Oswald
Spengler, Arnold Toynbee, Alfred Kroeber, and Pitrim Sorokin, all of
whom had written well-received books charting the rise and fall of
civilizations.15 By a peculiar connection, pulp and paper gave Innis the
opportunity to try his hand at this sort of universal narrative. In the
1930s, two Classics scholars, Milman Parry and Albert Lord, set about
trying to prove, horribile dictu, that the works of beloved Homer were
ﬁrst sung by ancient, pre-literate bards and only much later written
down.16 To demonstrate this outrageous thesis, they needed to show
that something of Homeric complexity, beauty, and length could be
composed and vocalized by unlettered minstrels. So they traveled to
the Balkans to record singers who, so it was said, still sang long heroic
tales. Sing they did, and Parry and Lord rocked the world of Classical
scholarship by demonstrating that “Homer” might have been an oral
tradition rather than a great writer. The traces of what came to be
known as “orality,” they showed, were evident in the written versions
of the Iliad and the Odyssey. The buzz about Parry and Lord’s research
could be heard in Classics departments all over the world, including that
at the University of Toronto. Innis knew people there, and knew them
well. Whether Professors Charles N. Cockrane or Edmund T. Owen
introduced Innis to Parry and Lord’s revolutionary work is not known,
but they are credited by Innis himself with stimulating his “interest in
the general problem” of communications history.17
Whatever the source, Innis realized that Parry and Lord’s primary
theoretical ﬁnding might be fruitfully extended: communications technologies might not only shape content, as orality had shaped the Iliad
and Odyssey, but they might also mold the societies in which they were
deployed. Over the next few years before his tragic death from cancer
in 1952, Innis explored this hypothesis with respect to two questions:
(1) How do new media arise? and (2) What do different media do?18
His answers, we hope to show, were in the main correct.

why media arise
Innis proposed that new media were “pulled” into broad use by rising
demand, not driven by rising supply. Demand comes ﬁrst and supply
follows. This theory has been validated by scholars studying the more
7

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

general process of technical innovation, adoption, and dissemination.19
Thanks to their work, we know what might be called the “rules” governing the discovery of a new tool, its initial use, and its spread through a
population. As we will see, new media follow these rules rather exactly.
Rule 1: Groups of tinkerers discover new technologies. How are new technologies conceived? We sometimes say that protean geniuses – your da Vincis,
Edisons, and Oppenheimers – come up with them, but that’s wrong. These
folks were smart and creative, but they had a lot of help.20 Others were on
the “trail of discovery,” and some were quite close to the end when the discovery was made. Alas, we forget about them in our haste to create idols.
We also sometimes say that “necessity is the mother of invention,” but that’s
wrong too. Clearly, something impels people to create, but we know it’s not
necessity.21 For the ﬁrst 170,000 years of human existence we lived under
dire necessity – thirst, hunger, disease – yet we invented almost nothing. Alas,
we seem to have forgotten that as well. What the record shows is that groups
of interested people – tinkerers – almost always stand behind the discovery
of new technologies. Tinkerers do not work alone, and they do not work
because they must. They work together with others on problems that may or
may not be “objectively” important.
Rule 2: Tinkerers can only discover the technologies in their technome. We
like to talk about technological “leaps,” moments at which we jump from
now into the future. This is a ﬂattering metaphor, but it’s inaccurate. Like evolutionary change, technological change is almost always incremental. Darwin
said natura non facit saltum; we should say technologia non facit saltum.
Indeed, the parallel is quite close. One of the principles of biological evolution is that the potential of a species to evolve new traits is constrained by its
genome, that is, the set of genes it has available. It might be evolutionarily
advantageous for your progeny to have wings, but it’s simply not possible
given the genes Homo sapiens has to work with. The same principle holds
for technological progress: the potential of tinkerers to invent new technologies is constrained by their “technome,” that is, the set of technologies (in
the broad sense) available to them. Leonardo and his colleagues probably
would have been pretty excited about building an A-bomb, but the technome
they were tinkering with didn’t have the technologies needed for them to
conceive, let alone build one. As in all things, you can only do what you
can do.
Rule 3: Technological supply does not produce technological demand. We
generally say that new technologies are invented because people ﬁnd them
useful. That, however, is not quite right. If it were, then we wouldn’t ﬁnd
that the supply of useful tools almost always outstrips demand for useful
8

INTRODUCTION

tools. For most of our history we’ve had what amounts to excess technical
capacity: we can build more tools than we can use. The reason is that tinkerers
do not always – or even very often before modern times – produce new
technologies because they think anyone will use them. They know that if you
build it, sometimes they will come and sometimes they won’t. But they build
it anyway, creating the aforementioned excess capacity.
Rule 4: Technological demand, if unfocused, does not produce technological
supply. We generally say that new technologies enter mass use because a
lot of people want them. That, however, isn’t quite right either. If it were,
then we would ﬁnd that mass demand for useful tools always translates into
mass supply, and it doesn’t. That’s because technological demand is often
unfocused. For a whole variety of reasons, new tools generally cost more
and are worth less when they ﬁrst appear than once they have been adopted
en masse.22 This is another way of saying that the barrier to early adoption
is higher than the barrier to late adoption. The problem is that the barrier
to early adoption is often too high for individuals, even if there are a large
number of them. Thus, for want of early adopters, the new tool never enters
mass use.
Rule 5: Only organized interests can produce the demand necessary to “pull”
a new technology into mass use. We live in an individualistic age and therefore think individuals make history. They don’t – at least not technological
history. Only what we will call “organized interests” can make technological history because only they can overcome the barriers to early adoption
mentioned above. Individuals are too poor to accomplish this feat, and so
are disorganized masses of individuals. Organized interests, however, can
“get the ball rolling” because they are coordinated and have a common purpose. They can create, gather, and pool resources; compel their members
and others to do their bidding; and focus their power on speciﬁc goals –
such as engineering and adopting a new technology. Organized interests can
take many forms and pursue many purposes. As a general rule, however, we
can identify three main types: economic organizations (businesses, industries,
classes), political organizations (functionaries, leaders, castes), and religious
organizations (believers, priests, orders).23 Almost whenever and everywhere
we ﬁnd complex society, we ﬁnd these sorts of organizations. Clearly there
is something essential about them, though just what it is extends far beyond
our present concerns.
Rule 6: When it comes to technological adoption, organized interests are
reactive and not proactive. We tend to think of organizations – outside ones
like revolutionary political parties – as conservative: they generally don’t
ﬁx things that aren’t manifestly broken. That’s exactly right as it concerns
9

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

the history of technology. Historically speaking, organized interests have
not adopted new tools in anticipation of some future change in conditions.
Rather, they have adopted new tools in response to some ongoing change in
conditions, particularly one that makes them unable to do something they
want to do. When these conditions arise, organized interests begin to search
for, engineer, and adopt new tools. More likely than not, those tools will
already be available in prototypical form because of excess technical capacity
(see Rule 3).
Rule 7: Organized interests are most likely to adopt new tools in response
to fundamentally new economic conditions. We ﬁnd it very easy to say
that Marx was “wrong.” But in fact he was right, at least about the longterm driver of technological development. There have been ﬁve fundamental shifts in the way humans make their livings: the Behavioral Revolution
(40,000 BC), the Agricultural Revolution (10,000 BC), the Capitalist Revolution (AD 1200), the Industrial Revolution (AD 1760), and the Information
Revolution (AD 1940). During each of these shifts, there was an upsurge
in innovation, adoption, and dissemination of new tools. It’s not hard to
understand why: the old tools, while still useful, didn’t work well under new
conditions, so new tools had to be brought into play. By Rules 1, 2, and 3
we know that the prototypes of these tools were available because of excess
capacity; by Rules 4, 5, and 6 we know that organized interests under pressure
to adapt to new conditions engineered, adopted, and spread them.

Together these rules suggest the following “pull” theory of media
adoption: “New Economic Conditions → Technical Insufﬁciency →
Increased Demand from Organized Interests → New Media Technology.” This theory, however, is not quite complete. As we hinted previously, there are two additional factors that affect the adoption process:
the timing of adoption and the nature of the technology adopted. As
to timing, there can be no doubt that the rate of adoption has been
increasing rapidly for at least the last 40,000 years. To take a pertinent
example, it took several thousand years for writing to go from idea to
widely used implement; it took only several decades for the personal
computer to do the same. The rate of adoption, therefore, is a function
of time. As to the nature of the technology adopted, there can be no
doubt that some tools are naturally more appealing than others. To take
another pertinent example, it took more than four centuries following
the introduction of the printing press for mass literacy to develop in
Europe; it took only a few decades for television to become a staple
of everyday life. Reading is hard and not much fun; watching is easy
10

INTRODUCTION

and fun. The rate of adoption, then, is also a clear function of natural
ease-of-use and enjoyment.

what media do
Innis argued that the physical attributes of media “push” societies
and ideas in new directions. This theory is largely correct, but needs
expansion and reﬁnement. We will re-formulate it as follows: “Medium
Attributes → Network Attributes → Social Practices and Values.” We
will argue that media, networks, and cultures each have their own typespeciﬁc attributes and that these attributes are causally related one to
the other. Let’s describe each set of attributes and the relationships
between them in turn.
Medium Attributes

Innis proposed a typology of medium attributes based on weight and
durability. This classiﬁcation has the virtue of simplicity, but it sacriﬁces
too much in terms of depth. We need something more complete. In order
to get it, we should put ourselves in the shoes of those who use media
and ask what really matters to them. Most basically, a medium is a
tool for sending, receiving, storing, and retrieving information. Given
these fundamental uses, what attributes would make a medium really
handy?
A handy medium would be inexpensive to obtain and easy to use. A
medium you can’t afford or don’t know how to operate is a bad medium,
or rather no medium at all as far as you’re concerned. For most of us,
television stations fall into this category – we can’t afford them (only
Rupert Murdoch can) and we don’t have the technical know-how to
operate them (only engineers do). A handy medium would be private,
or at least have a private mode. A medium that identiﬁes you and what
you’ve communicated as soon as you use it has drawbacks, especially if
you want to blow the whistle on some malefactor or subscribe to risqué
magazines. Sometimes you don’t want everyone to know your name
or what you’re reading. A handy medium would have high ﬁdelity,
meaning that the signal you want to send is the same as the signal
received. Speech, for example, does not have high ﬁdelity when it comes
to visual perceptions. If you see a white swan and then say to someone,
11

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

“I saw a white swan,” the person who hears you won’t see a white swan.
Rather, they will hear some words that indicate you saw a white swan.
Photography has higher ﬁdelity in this regard. If you see a white swan,
take a picture of it, and then hand the snapshot to someone, they will
see an image of the very same white swan you saw. A handy medium
would convey information in high volumes. With information, more
capacity – or, to use the obvious metaphor, “bandwidth” – is generally
better than less. You don’t really need to know some of what’s going
to be on the test, you need to know it all. Books are good for that.
A handy medium would move data quickly. No one likes to wait.
When you’re stuck in Podunk and your wallet’s been pilfered by street
urchins, you want money wired, not sent by letter. A handy medium
would store information for a long time. Sometimes the tax man comes
calling. And when he does, you’d better hope that your tax records
survived the basement ﬂood last year. Finally, a handy medium would
allow you to search, ﬁnd, and retrieve stored information easily. Stored
information that can’t be found isn’t really “stored” at all – it’s lost
and might as well not exist. Big libraries often have signs warning “a
misshelved book is a lost book.” Think about that the next time you
decide to do the library a favor by putting a book back on the shelf
yourself.
These considerations suggest the following media attributes are signiﬁcant from the perspective of the user:
Accessibility: the availability of a medium itself.
Privacy: the covertness with which data can be transmitted in a medium.
Fidelity: the faithfulness with which data can be transmitted in a
medium.
Volume: the quantity in which data can be transmitted in a medium.
Velocity: the speed with which data can be transmitted in a medium.
Range: the distance over which data can be transmitted in a medium.
Persistence: the duration over which data can be preserved in a medium.
Searchability: the efﬁciency with which data can be found in a medium.
We might well say that a really handy medium would possess all
of these attributes and a nearly useless medium would possess none
of them. That, however, would be a mistake. For in fact all media
possess them to one degree or another. It’s easy to see that speech

12

INTRODUCTION

has the attribute “accessibility” because virtually everyone has access
to it. It’s harder to understand that Chappe semaphore lines – series
of towers with manually operated signaling devices atop them – also
have the attribute “accessibility” given that almost no one has access
to them. But they do: after all, someone has access to them when they
were built. It’s just that speech has a lot of accessibility and the Chappe
semaphore line only has a little. Similarly, we might think that the way a
medium scores on an attribute is ﬁxed. Speech, we might say, will always
score well on accessibility, while Chappe semaphore lines will always
score poorly. That, however, would also be a mistake. Speech could be
made very inaccessible, for example, by cutting out everyone’s tongue.
Similarly, Chappe semaphore lines could be made very accessible, for
example, by building everyone their own semaphore tower. In principle,
then, any medium can be made to score well or poorly on any attribute
given a sufﬁcient outlay of resources. The actual score of a medium on
a particular attribute, then, is a function of cost. This insight enables us
to recast our deﬁnition of attributes as follows:
Accessibility: the cost of getting and using a medium.
Privacy: the cost of hiding the identity of users and the content of
messages in a medium.
Fidelity: the degree to which data in a medium are coded.
Volume: the cost of sending messages in a medium relative to size.
Velocity: the cost of sending messages in a medium relative to speed.
Range: the cost of sending messages in a medium relative to distance.
Persistence: the cost of storing messages in a medium relative to time.
Searchability: the cost of ﬁnding messages in a medium.
Where the cost is low, the score will be high; where the cost is high, the
score will be low. The cost of acquiring and using speech is generally
low, so it will be highly accessible. The cost of acquiring and using
Chappe semaphore lines is generally high, so they will be relatively
inaccessible.
Medium Attributes → Network Attributes

Innis proposed that media attributes directly affected what he called
“civilizations,” a vague and controversial term we would probably do

13

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

best to avoid. In its place we will use “media networks.” Media may or
may not do a lot of things (that’s what we are trying to ﬁnd out), but
there is no doubt that they directly and necessarily create networks. We
know this because it is a purely deﬁnitional matter. By deﬁnition, all
communications media allow people to communicate with one another.
By deﬁnition, when people communicate through a particular medium,
they become linked by that medium. And by deﬁnition, when they
become linked by the medium, a media network appears. Thus, speaking creates speech networks, writing creates writing networks, printing
creates print networks, electronic broadcast creates broadcast networks,
and surﬁng (or any of the myriad things we do on networked computers)
creates Internet networks. We sometimes forget that we create media
networks when we use media. The media networks just seem to be there.
Few of us think, when speaking to a friend, “I’m creating a speech network.” But in fact we are, just as certainly as telephone linesmen create
telephone networks when they string wire from pole to pole. Neither do
we often reﬂect on the fact that media networks are ﬁnite. They seem
to be everywhere. Few of us think, when speaking to our neighbor,
“Lucky this person is on the speech network, or I wouldn’t be able to
talk to her.” But we are lucky, because there are people who are not on
the speech network (mutes, those who do not speak our language), just
as surely as there are people who do not have telephones and therefore
are not on the telephone network.
We can now formulate a simple hypothesis about what media do:
different kinds of media foster different kinds of media networks. More
formally, media with attributes A1 , B1 , and C1 engender media networks
with corresponding attributes A2 , B2 , and C2 . This hypothesis seems
promising. Take one of the aforementioned medium attributes, range,
that is, the distance a medium can carry a message without signiﬁcant
decay. According to our conception, media with different ranges should
foster media networks with different attributes. Thus, unaided speech
has a short range and therefore the effective networks built with it
should be small. This seems correct. How many people are in your circle
of friends, a typical speech network? Perhaps a few dozen. Television
signals have a long reach and therefore the effective networks built with
them should be large. Again, this seems right. How many people watch a
major broadcast TV network? Millions. The correlation between spatial

14

INTRODUCTION

reach and network size we ﬁnd in the instances of speech and TV
should be true for media in general: media with short range create
geographically concentrated networks, while media with long range
create large, diffuse networks. As we will see, this is in fact the case.
Media, then, create media networks, and particular media attributes
create particular network attributes. Since there are eight signiﬁcant
media attributes, there should be at least eight corresponding media
network attributes. They are:
1. Accessibility → Concentration. Depending on the cost of getting
and using a medium, the network it fosters will be more or less
concentrated. Concentrated networks are those in which control
of the medium rests in the hands of a relative few; diffuse networks
are those in which control is dispersed throughout the network.
2. Privacy → Segmentation. Depending on the cost of hiding identities and the contents of messages in a medium, the network it
engenders will be more or less segmented. Segmented networks are
those in which senders, recipients, and the exchanged data can be
hidden from others; connected networks are those in which the
identities of senders and recipients and the data exchanged cannot
be hidden.
3. Fidelity → Iconicity. Depending on the cost of sending messages
relative to ﬁdelity in a medium, the network it engenders will be
more or less iconic. Iconic networks are those in which transmitted messages do not have to be laboriously decoded by the recipient (they are simply recognized); symbolic networks are those in
which messages must be manually decoded.
4. Volume → Constraint. Depending on the cost of transmitting messages relative to size in a medium, its network will be more or less
constrained. Unconstrained networks are those in which a large
amount of data can be easily exchanged and there is excess capacity; constrained networks are those in which only small amounts
of data can be exchanged and all available capacity has been
used.
5. Velocity → Dialogicity. Depending on the cost of exchanging
messages relative to speed in a medium, its network will be more
or less dialogic. Dialogic networks are those in which multiple

15

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

parties can easily exchange messages quickly; monologic networks
are those in which such exchange is difﬁcult.
6. Range → Extent. Depending on the cost of transmitting messages
relative to distance and reach (number of recipients) in a medium,
its network will be more or less extensive. Extensive networks
are those in which messages are exchanged over a large area or
number of people; intensive networks are those in which messages
are exchanged over a small area or number of people.
7. Persistence → Addition. Depending on the cost of preserving messages relative to time in a medium, its networks will be more or
less additive. Additive networks are those in which messages accumulate; substitutive networks are those in which new messages
replace old messages and therefore the amount of data is stable.
8. Searchability → Mappedness. Depending on the cost of ﬁnding
messages in a medium, the network constructed with it will be
more or less mapped. Mapped networks are those in which it
is easy to search, ﬁnd, and retrieve stored messages; unmapped
networks are those in which it is not.
Medium Attributes → Network Attributes → Social
Practices and Values

We have established “Medium Attributes → Network Attributes,” a
set of regularities that correlate eight properties of media with eight
characteristics of media networks. Now we face a ﬁnal challenge: we
must determine if and how these medium attributes, through the device
of network attributes, mold the way we live and what we believe. It’s
important to recognize that the entire media studies program as set
out by McLuhan rises or falls on this step. Either the medium is the
message – that is, media technologies in and of themselves shape human
institutions and values – or they don’t. That is what we will try to
ﬁnd out. Our hypothesis is this: media networks engender certain social
practices, and these social practices engender related values.24 There are
two separate arguments here: “Media Networks → Social Practices”
and “Social Practices → Values.” Let’s treat each in turn.
Among the most sensible things Marx ever wrote was this: “Men
make their own history, but they do not make it of their own free will;
they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but
16

INTRODUCTION

under circumstances directly found, given, and handed down from the
past.”25 This is a powerful statement. Despite what we might vainly
imagine, we are not free. Rather, we are constrained by “circumstances” we do not select, we do not create, and in many cases we
cannot alter. They are of two types. The ﬁrst circumstance is simply
human nature, the set of evolutionarily programmed behaviors that
distinguishes Homo sapiens as a species.26 We call them by various
names – “needs,” “impulses,” “reﬂexes,” “urges,” “hungers,” “wants,”
“desires,” “inclinations” – but in the end they are all the same: things we
are driven to do because it is in our nature to do them. The second circumstance is environmental, the varied physical and social terrain upon
which humans, driven by their natures, “make history.” This terrain has
many features, each of which constrains human action in different ways.
Famously, Marx investigated one such feature, the “mode of production”; we are investigating another feature, the “media network.” But
the basic explanatory logic is the same. Two sets of “circumstances” –
one biological and one historical – interact in such a way as to shape
human action, which in turn leads to the generation of particular social
practices. Humans need to do certain things. Different historical terrains – in our case media networks – either facilitate or impede the
fulﬁllment of those needs. According to whether they do the one or the
other, different social practices will emerge.
Marx also said something clever about the relationship between
social practices and values. “Ruling ideas,” he wrote, “are nothing
more than the ideal expression of ruling material relationships, the ruling material relationships grasped as ideas.”27 What he’s saying, inter
alia, is that what we actually do in relation to others determines to a
large extent what we think we should do. This is exactly the reverse
of what most people think about the relationship between actions and
values. We like to believe that we are, perhaps uniquely among animals,
moral creatures: we can know what is right and what is wrong. We can
know this, we say, because God has granted us a moral code (the religious version) or because we evolved a kind of innate moral sense (the
secular version). In either case, we don’t exactly decide what is right and
wrong. Our values are “just there,” an intrinsic part of the universe.
When we act, we say we are guided by these transcendental values.
The timeless “ought” shapes the temporal “is,” or at least should.
Marx – and he was hardly alone28 – believed we have it backward: the
17

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

earth-bound “is” molds the heavenly “ought.” We don’t do what we
should do because it’s right, we do what we should do because we’ve
deﬁned “should” in such a way that it justiﬁes what we want to do and
can do. This may seem awfully cynical, but there is no good reason to
see it that way. All Marx is trying to say (and all we are trying to say)
is that morality doesn’t fall out of the sky or emerge directly from your
genes, but rather results from a constant process whereby the “ought” –
beliefs, morals, ethics, norms, values, principles, standards, ideals – is
brought into line with the “is” – what we want to do, what we can do,
and what we actually do in pursuit of our interests.
Now that we have established that human nature and media networks constitute the “circumstances” that shape social practices, and
that particular social practices give rise to commensurate values, we are
ready to complete the theory of what media do to us. We saw that any
medium could be deﬁned in terms of eight attributes. Then we saw that
each of these attributes engendered a corresponding network attribute.
Now we’ll see how each network attribute tends to produce a corresponding set of social practices and values. In each of the following
cases, we have “Media Attributes → Media Network Attributes →
Social Practices + Values.”
1. Accessibility → Concentration → Hierarchicalization + Elitism.
The less accessible a medium, the more concentrated its network;
the more concentrated a network, the more social practices realized in it will be hierarchicalized. The link between concentration
and hierarchicalization is established by the innate human drive
for power over others: if humans can easily monopolize a scarce
resource – such as a medium – in order to use it as an instrument of domination, they will, and will establish corresponding
social practices. Concentration facilitates monopolization. In concentrated media networks, therefore, we should see hierarchical
social practices and an ideology – elitism – that legitimates them.
Elitism is premised on the idea that some are superior to others.
Conversely, the more accessible a medium, the more diffuse its
network; the more diffuse a network, the more social practices
realized in it will be equalized. Diffusion impedes monopolization. In diffuse media networks, therefore, we should see social

18

INTRODUCTION

practices characterized by equality among group members and an
ideology – egalitarianism – that afﬁrms equality. Egalitarianism is
rooted in the idea that no one is superior to anyone else.
2. Privacy → Segmentation → Closure + Privatism. The more private a medium, the more segmented its network; the more segmented a network, the more social practices realized in it will be
closed. The link between segmentation and closure is established
by the innate human desire to conceal: if humans can easily use a
medium to remove certain activities from public gaze – to privatize
them – they will, and will establish corresponding social practices.
Segmentation facilitates hiding. In segmented networks, therefore,
we should see multiple private social practices and an ideology –
privatism – that justiﬁes them. Privatism is premised on the idea
that information need not be shared. In contrast, the less private
a medium, the more connected its network; the more connected
a network, the more social practices realized in it will be opened.
Connection impedes hiding. In connected media networks, then,
we would expect to see few if any private spaces and an ideology –
publicism – that values transparency. Publicism is rooted in the
idea that information should be shared.
3. Fidelity → Iconicity → Sensualization + Realism. The higher the
ﬁdelity of a medium, the more iconic its network; the more iconic
a network, the more social practices realized in it will be sensualized. The link between iconicity and sensualization is established
by the innate human desire for physical pleasure: if humans can
conveniently use a medium to receive such pleasure, they will,
and will create commensurate social practices. Iconicity facilitates
physical pleasure-seeking. In iconic networks, therefore, we will
witness many social practices that stimulate the senses by realistic
depictions, especially of sound and sight, and an ideology – realism – that valorizes them. Realism is premised on the idea that the
seen world is more enriching than the unseen world. In contrast,
the lower the ﬁdelity of a medium, the more symbolic its network; the more symbolic a network, the more social practices in
and around it will be conceptualized. Conceptualization impedes
sensuality. In symbolic media networks, then, we would expect to
see abstracted social practices and an ideology – idealism – that

19

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

justiﬁes them. Idealism is rooted in the idea that the unseen world
is more enriching than the seen world.
4. Volume → Constraint → Hedonization + Hedonism. The higher
the volume of a medium, the less constrained its network; the
less constrained a network, the more social practices realized in
it will be hedonized and value entertainment. The link between
constraint and hedonization is established by the innate human
desire for diversion: if humans can easily use a medium for the
purposes of pleasant diversion, they will, and will establish matching social practices. Lack of constraint facilitates hedonistic use.
In an unconstrained network, therefore, we should see abundant
amusements and an ideology – hedonism – that justiﬁes them.
Hedonism is premised on the idea that the self develops through
experience. In contrast, the lower the volume of a medium, the
more constrained its network; the more constrained a network,
the more social practices realized in it will be economized. Constraint impedes divertive use of the media. In constrained media
networks we should see social practices in which self-denial is
practiced and an ideology – asceticism – that makes self-denial
a virtue. Asceticism is rooted in the idea that the self develops
through restraint.
5. Velocity → Dialogicity → Democratization + Deliberativism.
The faster a medium, the more dialogic its network; the more
dialogic a network, the more social practices realized in it will be
democratized. The link between dialogicity and democratization
is established by the innate human desire to express one’s self to
others: if humans can easily use a medium to be heard by others, they will, and will create related social practices. Dialogicity
facilitates expression. In dialogic networks, therefore, we would
expect to see democratic social practices and an ideology – deliberativism – that validates them. Deliberativism is premised on
the idea that everyone should speak for themselves. In contrast,
the slower a medium, the more monologic its network; the more
monologic a network, the more social practices realized in it will
be centralized. Monologicity impedes expression. In monologic
media networks, then, we should see centralized social practices
and an ideology – dictatorism – that justiﬁes them. Dictatorism is
rooted in the idea that some should speak for others.
20

INTRODUCTION

6. Range → Extent → Diversiﬁcation + Pluralism. The longer the
range of a medium, geographically and demographically, the more
extensive its network; the more extensive a network, the more
social practices realized in it will be diversiﬁed. The link between
extent and diversiﬁcation is established by innate human curiosity
about the present and the desire to learn about and from it: if
humans can use a medium to ﬁnd out about unfamiliar people
and things, they will, and will create social practices built on
these interests. Extensiveness facilitates exploration of the present.
In extensive media networks, therefore, we should see diversiﬁed
social practices and an ideology – pluralism – that defends them.
Pluralism is premised on the idea that there are many kinds of
people and things. In contrast, the shorter the range of a medium,
the more intensive its network; the more intensive a network, the
more social practices in it will be simpliﬁed. Intensiveness impedes
curiosity about the present. In intensive networks, then, we should
see simpliﬁed social practices and an ideology – monism – that
supports them. Monism is rooted in the idea that there is only one
kind of person and thing.
7. Persistence → Addition → Historicization + Temporalism. The
greater the persistence of a medium, the more additive its network;
the more additive a network, the more social practices realized in
it will be historicized. The link between persistence and historicization is constituted by innate human curiosity about the past
and the desire to learn about and from it: if humans can use a
medium to ﬁnd out about the past, and particularly people of
the past, they will, and will create social practices built on these
interests. Addition facilitates exploration of the past. In an additive network, therefore, we should see historicized social practices
and an ideology – temporalism – that supports them. Temporalism is premised on the idea that things change in time. In contrast,
the less persistent a medium, the more substitutive its network; the
more substitutive a network, the more social practices realized in
it will be ritualized. Substitution impedes exploration of the past.
In substitutive networks, then, we would expect to see ritualized
social practices and an ideology – eternalism – that validates them.
Eternalism is rooted in the idea that things have always been as
they are.
21

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

8. Searchability → Mapping → Amateurization + Individualism.
The more searchable a medium, the more mapped its network;
the more mapped a network, the more social practices realized in
it will be amateurized. The link between mapping and amateurization is established by the innate human need for autonomy, specifically to know for oneself: if humans can easily use a medium to
ﬁnd out what they need to know by themselves, they will, and will
establish commensurate social practices. Mapping facilitates independent discovery. In a mapped network, therefore, we should see
many “self-help” (in the generic sense) social practices and an ideology – individualism – that promotes self-reliance. Individualism
is premised on the idea that everyone is autonomous. In contrast,
the less searchable a medium, the less mapped its network; the
less mapped a network, the more social practices realized in it
will be professionalized. The lack of mapping impedes independent discovery. In unmapped media networks, then, we would
expect to see professions and an ideology – collectivism – that
validates them. Collectivism is rooted in the idea that everyone is
dependent on others.
Bear in mind that the attributes listed in the table are continuous;
they are presented here as extreme dichotomies simply for clarity’s sake.
For example, empirically speaking, particular media lie somewhere on
the continuum between high and low accessibility, networks between
diffuse and concentrated, social practices between equalized and hierarchicalized, and cultural values between egalitarian and elitist. It would
be interesting to try to quantify or score media, their networks, and
the social practices and values they engender. That task, however, goes
far beyond our limited goal, which is simply to demonstrate that different media have predictable effects on social practices and values.
Those effects may be – and in fact sometimes are – very subtle, but we
hope to show that they are usually present. The entire “push” theory is
summarized in Table 1.

If we are serious about understanding media, we need to formulate real
theories – the kind that associate speciﬁc causes with speciﬁc effects,
the kind that can be true or false on the evidence, the kind that allow

us to make predictions about what will happen if the theory is correct. I have laid out two such theories. The ﬁrst tries to explain why
certain media were adopted in certain times and places. The second
attempts to explain what media do to the way we live and what we
believe. Both make precise forecasts concerning what we should see in
the historical record. In what follows, we will test the theories on ﬁve
successive historical media: speech, writing, print, audiovisual media,
and the Internet. If what we have said is true, then the theories will
offer satisfying explanations as to why each medium spread and what
each did.

homo loquens
Humanity in the Age of Speech

Yes indeed, dear Phaedrus. But far more excellent [than writing], I think,
is . . . the art of dialectic.1
– Plato, Phaedrus, 276E

Most people know Plato as the world’s ﬁrst philosopher, but he was
also the world’s ﬁrst media critic. Plato wanted to ﬁnd the Truth, and
he said that the only way to do it was using a method he called “dialectic.” By this he meant reasoned discussion, a kind of debate in which
real people present arguments and other real people afﬁrm or refute
them by means of logic. He showed how one could use dialectic to
arrive at the Truth in the dialogues for which he is justly famous. Plato,
however, not only used his dialogues to demonstrate how to get to the
Truth, but also to explain what the Truth was. And one of the Truths he
pointed out was that some of his competitors were selling philosophical
snake oil. These were the rhetoricians, professional speechwriters in the
ancient Hellenic world. They were charlatans, Plato complained, and
not really interested in the Truth at all. Rather, their only aim was to
teach politicians to ﬂatter their constituents, to feed what Plato pejoratively called the “Great Beast” of public opinion. Instead of showing
statesmen the light, the rhetoricians transformed them into pastry chefs
who served up sweets according to vulgar tastes without thought as
to whether they were healthy or not (Gorgias, 465A).2 For Plato, you
either discuss or deceive. Philosophers discussed, rhetoricians and those
they trained deceived. There was no middle ground. It’s little wonder
that Plato banished rhetoric from the ideal city he described in The
Republic. There was just no place for it.

Plato thought people were meant to talk to one another, not at one
another. He was more right than he knew. As we’ll see in this chapter,
nature fashioned Homo sapiens into a creature both fantastically skilled
in dialogic communication and driven to engage in it. We do not talk
because we want to. We talk because we have to. In this sense, we are all
natural-born Platonists – eager, tireless, unstoppable talkers. Talking is
in our natures, so it is with talking that we should begin our history of
media and their consequences.

why we talk
There is an important sense in which talking is not like later media: we
did not invent it. Talking happened to us, just like the ability to grasp
with our hands, walk on our legs, and stick out our tongues. This being
so, any explanation of the rise of talking must be couched in terms of
natural selection, and that means the origins of talking afford us no
opportunity to test our “pull” theory of media origins. Its ﬁrst trail
must wait for writing, the ﬁrst invented medium. For now, we need to
talk about the evolution of talking.
Why did we, uniquely among all animals, evolve the ability to talk?
The answer may seem obvious. We came to talk because it was to our
evolutionary advantage to talk. And this is true. Those proto-humans
who could talk produced more offspring than those who couldn’t, and
gradually the genetic capacity for talking spread throughout the species
until everyone could talk. But this appeal to evolutionary advantage, as
commonsensical as it may be, isn’t very satisfying, primarily because it
doesn’t explain speciﬁcally why it was to our evolutionary advantage
to talk. Evolutionary theorists are aware of this problem and they have
advanced many theories regarding exactly what talking did for us, evolutionarily speaking.3 They say we evolved talking because it enabled
us to make better tools, or to share more information, or to exchange
gossip, or impress members of the opposite sex. Some of these theories
make good sense, but they all raise a troublesome question of their own:
why don’t other mammals in our branch of the tree of life talk?
In A Treatise of Human Nature (1739), the English philosopher
David Hume proposed a fundamental principle of scientiﬁc reasoning:
“the same cause always produces the same effect.”4 It’s a good rule,

27

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

and has stood the test of time. But apparently it doesn’t apply to the
evolution of talking, at least as laid down by some evolutionary theorists. According to them, the ancestors of humans began to talk because
doing so helped them do X, Y, and Z, where X, Y, and Z improved their
ability to reproduce, or “ﬁtness.” Following Hume’s lead, then, if we
were to ﬁnd another ancestral species that would have beneﬁted from
X, Y, and Z – as proto-humans did – then we should expect its descendants to talk. As Hume said, like causes should produce like effect. The
problem is that we know there were other primate species that deﬁnitely
would have beneﬁted from X, Y, and Z but did not evolve the ability
to talk. For example, the ancestors of modern chimps, who were both
much like proto-humans and lived in a similar environment, would have
proﬁted from the ability to make better tools, share more information,
exchange gossip, and impress members of the opposite sex. Neither
chimps nor any higher mammal, however, ever developed anything like
human language. So here we have a like cause – the supposed general
utility of speech – but a different effect – no talking.
The fact that humans can talk and chimps can’t leads us to another,
much more productive question: Why was it advantageous for humans
to talk and not other species of higher mammals, proto-chimps in particular? The French scholar Jean-Louis Dessalles has given a novel and
convincing answer. It can be summarized as follows.5
Many higher mammals, proto-humans among them, probably lived
in small groups millions of years ago. The fact that they did (and most
of their ancestors still do) presents an evolutionary puzzle: group living
is a form of cooperation and, according to Darwin, animals are dyedin-the-wool genetic egomaniacs. They are supposed to want to pass on
their genes, and not to give a whit about those of strangers. It’s hard
to imagine, then, why any strictly self-interested organism would help
another strictly self-interested organism, unless the two were genetically
related. In that case, what appears to be altruistic isn’t, because by
helping your sister pass on her genes you are actually helping yourself
pass on your genes because the two of you share genes.6 This kind
of passage-by-proxy is common in the animal kingdom. What’s rarer
is cooperation among genetically unrelated individuals. The reason is
clear: cooperation is risky. To employ the obvious metaphor, say you
and I agree to scratch each other’s backs. If we can scratch at the same
time, there is no problem as neither of us can really cheat. But if we
28

HOMO LOQUENS

go by turns, a sticky question arises: who’s going to go ﬁrst? How do
I know you won’t renege on the deal the minute I’m done scratching
your back? I don’t, so I’m not going to make the deal. Thus, cooperation
never evolves. Evolutionarily speaking, one way to make cooperation
spread in a species is to make cheating costly.7 This obviously happened,
because cooperation evolved. We aren’t sure just how it occurred, but
it probably had something to do with the development of reputations.8
If you are able to remember that someone cheated you (a capacity that
itself must be evolved), you are not likely to do business with her again:
once bitten, twice shy. The same is true of others observing the cheater:
once observed biting, twice avoided. Over time, the cheater will develop
a bad reputation. Eventually, no one will cooperate with him, and so
in effect his cheating is made very costly. His genes will decline in the
population, as will the propensity to cheat. Since cheating always pays
sometimes, however, it will never be extinguished completely.
Our ancestors, living in small groups, had overcome the initial barriers to low-level cooperation by the time our line hived off the protochimp line some six million years ago. The extent of their cooperative
capacities, however, did not end there, for the proto-human group itself
had internal collaborative structures.9 Judging by modern chimp communities (and there is good reason to do this, as chimps are very evolutionarily conservative, that is, they haven’t changed much in six million
years), two of these subgroups were most important: the mother-child
pair and the multi-male coalition. The former need not concern us,
as its evolutionary logic is quite straightforwardly kin-selective: chimp
mothers invest in their children in order to ensure their own genes are
passed on to later generations. The multi-male coalition, however, is of
greater interest.10 It is a temporary alliance that forms to impose political dominance within the group and to protect group assets (females,
territory) from interlopers. In a typical power grab, a small number of
ambitious male chimps will form a raiding party and, using superior
strength, violently subdue their enemies. The result is often a bloody
mess, with the vanquished losing limbs and even lives. The victorious
coalition will then rule the group until the alliance falls apart or another,
stronger coalition comes along.
It’s reasonably easy to see how the propensity to form multi-male
coalitions would be selected for: those in the triumphant coalitions
breed more than their competitors, so their coalition-forming genes are
29

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

passed on and spread throughout the species. One might think that the
opportunity to cheat would hinder the evolution of coalitions, but this
isn’t the case. Though the alliances are far from stable, there is little
opportunity to cheat effectively as the contribution of members can
be veriﬁed continuously. The exchange that goes on in the coalition is
simultaneous, not serial. Everyone in the raiding party is murderously
pummeling his competitors at the same time. They don’t take whacks
by turns. Thus, if one of the coalition members doesn’t pull his weight,
the others will notice immediately and the coalition will disintegrate
with no great loss to the remaining members. In that sense, then, there
really can’t be any sustained cheating in a multi-male coalition – there
can only be defection and dissolution.
From the coalition members’ perspective, the real problem with
alliances isn’t cheating, but that of selecting the right allies. This choice
is crucial, as it will largely determine how often you breed. But how
do you know whom to team up with? Clearly, you want to pick allies
with characteristics that are predictive of ﬁghting and mating success.
For chimps, this is some combination of size, strength, and, perhaps,
loyalty (as evinced by grooming behavior). This propensity to go with
the “big guy” when seeking allies would seem to be widespread among
all higher mammals, humans included. If you recall (painful though it
is), the schoolyard bully had a lot of “friends.” The difﬁculty is that
this criterion for selection loses its effectiveness as competing coalitions
grow in size. A big guy can tip the balance in ﬁghting between small
groups, say ones with only two or three members. But a big guy is not
going to make much of a difference in a struggle between large coalitions, particularly if outnumbered. In a contest between a large and a
small coalition, the large coalition is usually going to win even if the
small one has the big guy. Even the schoolyard bully and his sycophantic
underlings couldn’t take on all of you.
Thanks to the work of the evolutionary anthropologist Robin Dunbar, we have good reason to believe that shortly after the proto-human
line split off from the proto-chimp line, the size of proto-human groups
and the multi-male coalitions in them began to increase.11 If you:
(a) measure the brains of living primate species; (b) determine the size
of the groups in which they typically live; and then (c) compare the two
data sets, you get a positive correlation: as brain size increases, so does
typical group size. It stands to reason that what is true of living primates
30

HOMO LOQUENS

was probably true of extinct apes, that is, as their brain size increased,
so did their group size. Happily, we know quite a bit about the cranial capacity (a proxy for brain size) of our ancestors: Australopithecus
afarensis had a cranial capacity of around 450 cc; Homo habilis, around
500 cc; Homo erectus, 1,250 cc; and Homo sapiens, 1,450 cc. Using
the aforementioned brain-size/group-size formula, Australopithecines
typically would have lived in groups of about 65 individuals. Moving
forward in time, Homo habilis lived in groups of around 80 individuals; Homo erectus lived in groups of around 130 individuals; and early
Homo sapiens lived in groups of 150 individuals. To put this in perspective, modern chimps have brains of about 400 cc and live in groups
averaging about 50 individuals.
If it is correct that the size of proto-human groups and subgroups
grew in this way, then it seems reasonable to infer that the chimp
strategy for picking allies based on strength, size, and loyalty became
unworkable for our ancestors. Male chimps still living in small bands
could go on as they always had – and, in fact, still do – picking the
big guy. But proto-humans looking for allies had to select another
characteristic. Dessalles proposes that this criterion was the ability to
communicate “relevance.”12 “Relevance” here means utterances that
will proﬁt a listener and thereby recommend the speaker as an ally. If
you can regularly say “there’s some food over there” and be right, then
you have signaled to me that you can probably do me some good and
therefore that I should select you as a partner. Being relevant helps you
a lot: the more relevant you are, the more allies you will have; the more
allies you have, the larger your coalition; the larger your coalition,
the more likely it will be that it will dominate the band; the greater
your coalition’s dominance of the band, the greater your fecundity; the
greater your fecundity, the faster your relevance-producing genes will
be spread throughout the population. As individuals like you compete
with one another to be relevant, the average level of relevance increases
until, well, we all speak like humans.
Dessalles’s argument rests on the theory of “costly signaling.” It
holds that ﬁt individuals display their relative superiority by means of
true signals that seem to tempt fate.13 The peacock’s tail is the classic
example. A garish fan of plumage doesn’t seem to do the peacock
any good insofar as it exposes him to predators and makes escape
difﬁcult. But a big tail also says, “I’m so ﬁt that it doesn’t matter who
31

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

sees me or whether I can get away. Bring ’em on! Now let’s mate.”
If the ostentatious peacock succeeds in mating more often than his
competitors before he gets killed and eaten, then his rakish ornament
will have done its evolutionary work. Speech, Dessalles says, evolved in
the same way as the peacock’s tail except the costly signal wasn’t bright
feathers but relevant words. Speaking, then, is a kind of dangerous
showing off.
At ﬁrst blush, this position doesn’t seem very promising. In order
for costly signaling to drive natural selection, it must be costly. Outside
of places like courtrooms, words ordinarily aren’t. Most conversations,
after all, seem to be of no consequence at all unless you are really
interested in, say, the weather. But, Dessalles points out, that’s only
the way it seems. Speech is costly in that it exposes the speaker to the
judgment of listeners and that judgment strongly, if not immediately,
affects the speaker’s ﬁtness. Speaking shows listeners you have guts,
that you are willing to put your status on the line. And if you speak
well – that is, relevantly – it shows listeners that you might be a good
ally. Of course, speaking is risky: you could “put your foot in your
mouth” and lose status and, ultimately, ﬁtness. But that’s the price you
pay to play the relevance game. In this view, speech is not so much a
form of cooperation as a contest between speakers for the approbation
of listeners. You don’t play the relevance game because you genuinely
want to help people, though you might tell yourself that and believe it.
You play because – whether you know it or not – there is something in
it for you, namely, status and ﬁtness.
If Dessalles’s theory that speech emerged from countless rounds of
the relevance game is correct, then we should ﬁnd several things to
be true about the way we think and speak today. This is to say that
thinking and speaking should be optimized for competition in the game.
And here we come to what is perhaps the greatest strength of Dessalles’s
theory, for he shows that this is precisely the case: the reasons we came
to speak then can be seen in the way we think and talk now.
Humans, Dessalles points out, are extraordinarily good at identifying, remembering, and recalling anomalies. Cats are specially attuned
to sense movement. Bats are specially attuned to sense sound. Humans
are specially attuned to sense things that are out of the ordinary. Each
of us has in our heads a kind of probabilistic model of the world. As

32

HOMO LOQUENS

we perceive new things, we unconsciously compare them to the model
and update it. Only really unusual things are likely to come into our
conscious minds, but they will do so reﬂexively. Completely ordinary
things, like the fact that there is a red car on the road in front of us,
are not even consciously registered. More unusual things, like the fact
that the red car is swerving slightly, might draw our passing attention. But really strange things, like the fact that the swerving red car
seems to have no driver! pop right into our minds. We can’t help but
think about them because they are so at odds with our model of the
world. A car with no driver is relevant indeed. After all, it might just
kill you.
Not only do we notice anomalies, but we often look for them and,
when we ﬁnd them, investigate them.14 Humans, Dessalles notes, are
naturally curious. If something “just doesn’t ﬁt” we will often try to
ﬁgure it out, to make it consistent with our picture of the world. To
return to the driverless car, it wouldn’t be far outside the scope of
normal human behavior for someone, having witnessed this oddity, to
at least have the impulse to overtake the car to see what exactly was
going on. In fact, not a few of us would act on this urge just to satisfy
our inborn curiosity. From an evolutionary point of view, this is strange
behavior. Why would someone risk her life just to ﬁnd out why there
is no driver in a nearby moving car? Yet people do this sort of thing all
the time. Dessalles has a good explanation: we are gathering valuable
information, information that can be used in the relevance game. Seeing
a driverless car is a relevant fact, the foundation of what we usually call
a “good story.” But being able to explain why the car could continue
on its way without a driver is even more relevant, and can serve as
the ending to an even better story. Unconsciously, your mind calculates
the risks and rewards. Should you overtake the car and get the facts
or should you hang back and forgo their reward? You remember that
“curiosity killed the cat,” a relevant proverb indeed. But you let your
curiosity get the better of you and you speed ahead for a peek. You see
that it’s really no mystery at all, it’s only . . .
Naturally you want to know what it was, what explains the driverless
car. You can’t wait to ﬁnd out. Neither, for that matter, can you wait
to tell someone once you do. We like to think that speech is something
under our conscious control. We speak when we want and we don’t

33

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

when we don’t. But, as Dessalles shows, that just isn’t so. When we
come across a relevant fact, we automatically notice it and remember it.
We may even be impelled to investigate it despite considerable danger.
But the force of our mental compulsion to be relevant does not end
there. Once we have a relevant fact in our possession, we cannot help
but relate it to someone. The fact that humans will speak reﬂexively is
widely known, but reﬂexive speaking is usually understood to be limited
to physically or emotionally prompted outbursts. You say “Ouch!”
when you are pricked by a needle. You say “Damn!” when you get
upset. But if you think about it carefully, you’ll see that sometimes you
automatically blurt out entire sentences and even entire stories. Take
the moment at which you saw that the red car had no driver. You might
have unconsciously, though quite audibly, said, “Well I’ll be damned.
That car has no driver!” even though there was nobody there to hear
you. This seemingly purposeless utterance, Dessalles would argue, is a
reﬂex of what might be called your “relevance organ.” To your brain,
the fact of a driverless car was just too relevant not to put into words,
even though no one would hear them but you. Now take yourself to
the moment after you ﬁgured out why the car had no driver. You might
think, “I can’t wait to tell so-and-so.” And when you are next in the
presence of so-and-so, you unthinkingly and automatically launch into
the story about the car with no driver, and how you risked your life
to discover why it had no driver. You get pleasure from sharing your
relevance.
We sometimes think that the basic purpose of speech is the exchange
of information. You tell me this, and I’ll tell you that, and we’ll both
be better off. There is something to this theory, but it’s not a good
description of what actually goes on in a typical conversation. According to Dessalles, conversations are not structured by quid pro quos. In
fact, they are much more like performances in which a speaker presents
something relevant for the entertainment and enlightenment of a listener. Imagine that you are telling the story of the driverless car to
so-and-so. How does that person behave? She doesn’t exchange information, rather she listens and probes. You do most of the talking, but
occasionally she interrupts to make a remark or ask a question. She
might say “really?” as if to cast doubt on what you’ve claimed, or she
might say “that’s interesting” as if to afﬁrm that your story is believable.
She might even say something like “Oh, I’ve seen tons of driverless cars.
34

HOMO LOQUENS

So what?” in order to suggest that your story, though perhaps true, is
not really relevant, as it matches her picture of the world rather exactly.
By Dessalles’s lights, the listener behaves this way because she has
been programmed by natural selection to carefully evaluate the truth
and relevance of your utterances, to judge you as a potential ally. The
ability to separate the conversational wheat from the chaff by means
of meticulous interrogation clearly would have been selected for in the
contest to appear relevant. Cheating is a real danger in the relevance
game. The speaker is often reporting things that occurred in the past
or in some distant locale. In the case of the car sans driver, the thing
reported is both. The listener, therefore, cannot directly verify the truth
of the speaker’s claims. Speakers know this, so they will often “gin
up” the relevance of what they report, and sometimes they will just
lie. Advertisers take advantage of the ﬁrst of these rhetorical strategies,
and con men use the second. The only means a listener has to check
the relevance and veracity of a speaker’s report is to probe it while it
is being related. In practice, this means testing it for logical consistency
(the car can’t be red and blue), testing it for empirical consistency (the
car can’t ﬂy), testing it for relevance (a driverless car must be judged
unusual). If, under examination, the speaker fails any of these tests, then
his report will be dismissed and his status will fall. If he fails dramatically, then he will be judged mentally incompetent and a candidate for
institutionalization of one sort or another. In conversation, you must be
truthful and relevant. If you aren’t, then you’re worthless, criminal, or
crazy.
A nose for anomalies, a penchant for problem solving, a compulsion
to speak, an impulse to question – all of these things are echoes of the
age-old competition to be more relevant than others, to improve our
status in the eyes of others, to gain allies and, ultimately, to pass on our
genes. The result of this struggle was man the talker, Homo loquens.
The forces of natural selection programmed all primates to do several
things – to eat, to sleep, to mate, to live with others. Every primate
instinctively does these things and indeed ﬁnds pleasure in them. But
only humans instinctively talk and ﬁnd joy in talking. Why, then, do we
talk? The answer has two parts. The ﬁrst is this: evolutionarily speaking,
we talk because we were the only primates who gained social status
and therewith ﬁtness by talking. The second is this: psychologically
speaking, we talk because we must be heard.
35

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

what talking did
Talking was the ﬁrst uniquely human medium, and – setting aside
gesture – for more than 150,000 years it was the only medium we
knew. There was no writing, no printing, no audiovisual media, and
no Internet. If you wanted to convey complex meaning, the only way
to do it was by talking to someone. According to our “push” theory
of media effects, speech should have had a profound impact on early
human social practices and values; it should have formed the basis of
a distinct Talking Culture in the distinct Talking Era (180,000 BC to
3500 BC).
What evidence, primary and secondary, is available to test this theory? The primary evidence is very thin: early hunter-gatherers left
remarkably little in the way of physical artifacts. One can learn something of ancient hunter-gatherers by studying their modern counterparts – a standard technique in the ﬁeld – but these comparisons are
problematic.15 Given the lack of good primary data, one can only marvel that paleoanthropologists are able to say anything at all about the
way early humans lived. What they can say tends to be general and not
related to the impact of talking on living.16 It would be helpful, then, if
we had another source. Happily, we do: our daily observation of modern intimate groups like the family, circle of friends, and workplace.
These groups share two characteristics that make them comparable to
the early hunter-gatherer band: they are small and they do most of
their business through face-to-face verbal communication. Naturally,
the analogy is hardly exact: your ofﬁce isn’t the savannah and your
co-workers aren’t your relatives (if you’re lucky). Nonetheless, it has
the cardinal advantage of familiarity. Without any additional study, we
already know by direct and daily observation how speech and memory
shape our intimate groups; therefore, it shouldn’t be very difﬁcult to
make inferences about how they affected early hunter-gatherer bands.
We will use this technique, albeit cautiously, in all that follows.
Accessibility

Talk, as they say, is cheap. So is hearing, though we don’t usually
acknowledge it. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of us are
born with all the equipment we need to both send speech and receive
36

HOMO LOQUENS

it: a mouth, a pair of ears (though one will do), and a brain capable
of encoding and decoding language. Setting aside the problem of nonnative languages, you don’t need to be formally taught to send and
receive “your” auditory code using these on-board tools, so there are
no initial training costs if you are healthy. Speech and hearing are not
only easy to get, they are inexpensive to use. Once you begin speaking,
the per-unit costs of production – encoding and transmitting messages –
are low. You can easily produce 150 words a minute in your native
language.17 For the cost of a good night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast,
you can therefore speak 34,200 words if you begin at 9:00 AM and
quit at noon. Receiving spoken messages – that is, hearing and decoding
them – is also inexpensive. A native speaker can understand 250 words
per minute with fair comprehension.18 So, a well-rested and well-fed
listener can take in all of your 34,200 words, though she will probably
think you something of a bore. Speech and auditory comprehension
are so easy that we are not really even conscious of the fact that we
are using them. Moreover, speech and hearing are hard to take away,
which is to say make them more expensive than they naturally are.
Tyrants, maﬁas, and gangs try to muzzle people and prevent them from
saying and hearing things all the time, both with credible threats of
violence and violence itself. Sometimes force works, especially when
taken to extremes. If your tongue has been cut out, then you will not
speak. If your eardrums have been punctured, then you will not hear.
And if you have been murdered, then, well, you are dead and can’t do
much at all. Yet such measures are often themselves dangerous: people,
no matter how downtrodden, tend to get angry when they or their
relatives are mutilated or murdered, and when people are angry they
tend to lash out. Good tyrants know to avoid making their subjects too
angry. For this reason, and especially in modern times, efforts to silence
people and to prevent them from listening to banned speech have usually
failed. The dictators of the former Soviet Union and East Germany, for
example, created the most robust surveillance and censorship apparatus
ever known, and they coupled it with a brutal speech code. If you said
or heard the wrong thing in Moscow or East Berlin, you could do quite
a bit of hard time, and your family would probably suffer as well. But
people still talked and listened – in kitchens, in parks, and sometimes
even to the Western press. They did this knowing that they might be
caught, and knowing that they would “pay the price.” But they couldn’t
37

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

help themselves. As we’ve already pointed out, talking – and listening,
for that matter – only seem to be acts of pure will, when in actual
practice they are often psychological reﬂexes. If you really have to say
something, you’ll probably say it. If someone says something of interest
in earshot, you’ll probably listen.
The fact that talking and listening are cheap and difﬁcult to make
expensive means that they comprise the most accessible medium ever
known – speech. In terms of access, then, speech networks are diffused: almost everyone in the community possesses the means to send
and receive messages using it. According to our theory, diffuse media
networks will equalize social practices realized within and around
them. Here “equalize” means to establish relations of rough parity
among members. The reason is this: as a purely practical matter, diffuse networks make everyone equal as far as communication is concerned; thus, diffusion blocks the road to media monopolization and
inequality.
This is true in intimate speech networks today. Groups such as the
family, friendship circle, and workplace operate within a context of relative equality among members because they have no other way to get
things done. Of course parents are still parents, the popular kid is still
the popular kid, and the boss is still the boss. But as anyone who has
held one of these so-called positions of authority will attest, the fact that
everyone can chime in at almost any moment imposes practical limits
on power. Even if you hold formal authority, you need to get along to
be an effective leader. Members of the team must be respected; they will
have their say, and everyone will be allowed to listen. Much the same
must have been true in the early hunter-gatherer band. Unequal authority was exercised in all manner of social practices. Adults had more
authority than children; men had more of it than women; Big Men had
more of it than Little Men. Nonetheless, all (adult) members of the band
were permitted to have their say and listen, primarily because no one
could effectively stop them. The Big Man might try to stop someone
from chiming in or hearing this or that, but such an attempt would
entail signiﬁcant risks. If a ﬁght ensued, there was no telling who would
get the better of whom. And even if the Big Man triumphed and his foe
were silenced or denied the right to listen, his victory would probably
be temporary, for his foe would live to talk another day. The Big Man
could permanently quiet a loquacious critic or overly attentive listener
38

HOMO LOQUENS

by killing him or her, but that too would bring serious repercussions. In
hunter-gather bands, murder was strongly discouraged: almost everyone was, after all, related to everyone else (if distantly) and no one was
really expendable. From the perspective of the majority of band members, a murderous Big Man was not a very good Big Man, and should
probably be removed – permanently.
In both the ancient hunter-gatherer band and our intimate speech
communities today, the diffusion of speech shaped values. The fact
that everyone was going to be able to speak and listen had to be
accommodated ethically, and it was via a rough-hewn egalitarianism.
In terms of communications, people were equal and therefore it was
believed they should be equal, or at least relatively so. By this code,
ancient Big Men were not allowed to act tyrannically and modern
ofﬁce managers are not allowed to muzzle anyone capriciously. Moreover, equal access to speech and hearing promoted the notion that
property should be held in common, that goods and food in particular should be shared, and that everyone had a duty to take care of
everyone else. This was probably more true among hunter-gatherers
than it is in the modern family, circle of friends, or workplace. But
even in these cases we believe that sharing and mutual aid are right and
proper. Remember, if you bring something, you should bring enough for
everyone.
Privacy

If we were in the business of shooting at people, we would probably
want weapons that didn’t give away our position. Guns with silencers
and ﬂash suppressors, for example, would enable us to attack them
without them knowing where we were. That’s good for us and bad for
them. It’s simple to imagine situations in which it would be advantageous for us to be able to talk or listen to them without “giving away our
position,” that is, our identities. Such a capacity would make whistleblowing and eavesdropping much easier. But, for good or ill, no one has
really ﬁgured out how to bring off face-to-face anonymity. You have to
be pretty good with masks, makeup, or false mustaches to fool anyone
looking right at you, and most of us aren’t. You might be well-practiced
at disguising or even throwing your voice, but you aren’t going to be
able to disguise it for very long or to throw it very far. Then there’s
39

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

lying about who you are. Grifters are good at this, but most of us regular folks aren’t. Concealing your identity when speaking or listening
to someone is made that much more difﬁcult by humankind’s virtuosic
ability to remember faces and, to a lesser extent, voices.19 You probably
don’t remember your own driver’s license number, even though you’ve
looked at it, repeated it out loud, and written it down many times.
But you only need to see, talk with, and listen to someone once to ﬁx
his face and voice in your memory. And, of course, everyone remembers your face and voice as well, which means the minute they see
you or hear you speak, you’re going to “give away your position.” As
in the Wizard of Oz, so in face-to-face communications: the man behind
the curtain usually doesn’t remain behind the curtain for long. That’s
the nature of in-person talking and listening: it’s public and there is no
getting around that fact. Naturally you can talk and listen to yourself,
but one wonders whether that’s really conversing with someone in the
sense we mean. Besides, you might be seen or overheard. You can also
talk and listen to people in private, but isn’t that just conversing in a
smaller public? And who’s to say your conﬁdants won’t leak who you
are and what you said to a larger public? You could swear them to
secrecy, but just what is “secrecy”? Does that mean they can’t tell their
wives or husbands? They don’t think so. So they tell their spouses, who
are not sworn to secrecy, with predictable results. Your cover, if you
ever had it, is blown.
In sum, if you talk or listen to people face-to-face, they – and probably
a lot of others – are going to know who you are and what you said.
In-person conversation is intrinsically public. Media that are public will
necessarily engender networks that are connected, which is to say the
identities of those on the network as well as who communicated what to
whom will be widely known. Following our theory, connected networks
will open social practices. Here, “open” means making known who is
doing what with whom. The reason is this: you can’t easily hide who
you are or what you are doing on a connected network – information
ﬂows too freely.
This is apparent in our own tiny speech networks today. It is notoriously difﬁcult to keep things secret in a family, circle of friends, or
workplace. “Word gets around” and there is little you can do about it.
So it was in early hunter-gatherer bands. It is difﬁcult to imagine how
any of the band’s major activities – political, economic, cultural – could
40

HOMO LOQUENS

have been concealed from public view. They were all organized via
face-to-face verbal interaction and were therefore difﬁcult to hide. This
is not to say that everything done was known to everyone. People had
secrets, both individual and shared. If they didn’t they wouldn’t have
been able to practice deception, which is essential to human nature and
perhaps even to human well-being. Nor is it to say that early humans
had no private life. There are certain social activities – having sex, giving
birth – that nearly every human culture has hidden from public gaze.
Doubtless the hunter-gatherers had a set of private activities as well.
The point is that with no privatizable medium and thus no segmented
network relations, the proportion of social practices that were pursued
in public with full knowledge of all network members was necessarily
greater than that in a context with privatizable media and segmented
network relations. There was no place to hide.
The necessary public-ness of speech shaped values in early huntergatherer bands and continues to do so in small modern speech networks today. The fact that nothing could truly be private had to be
accommodated ethically, and it was via publicism, the idea that information – and especially high-value information – should be shared. In
the hunter-gatherer band the code implied that band members must
speak openly and truthfully about things that affected the entire band,
which, in this conﬁned context, was virtually everything. In contrast,
people who kept things to themselves, attempted to hide things from the
group, or consistently lied to others would be condemned as selﬁsh. In
an all-talking environment, words were common property and had to
be shared. Much the same is true in our intimate circles today: among
family members, friends, and co-workers we believe we are obliged to
share the truth where it concerns our common affairs. If you don’t, you
will be deemed “untrustworthy.”
Fidelity

Speech is remarkable in that you can describe and transmit almost
anything you sense with it. Imagine you have just returned from a
relaxing nap in a ﬁeld of daisies. You want to “paint the picture”
(metaphorically speaking) to your friend. You gazed at a clear and blue
sky. You heard the birds singing in the distance. You smelled spring
ﬂowers in the air. You tasted honeysuckle on your lips. You felt the
41

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

breeze brushing your face. You may have sensed all these things, but the
person to whom you describe them will sense none of them. She will not
see the sky, hear the birds, smell the daisies, taste the honeysuckle, or feel
the breeze. All she will sense – speciﬁcally, hear – is a ﬂow of meaningbearing sounds, spoken words built into spoken sentences like “The air
smelled of spring ﬂowers.” She will understand you were dozing in a
ﬁeld of daisies, but will not sense anything like what you sensed. This
is because speech represents data from all ﬁve senses (vision, sound,
smell, taste, and feeling) through one encoded sensory channel (sound).
Speech is a ﬁve-to-one code. As such, the only sense data that it can
represent iconically is sound, and only those sounds within the range of
the human vocal apparatus (that is, those that can be mimicked). Here,
“iconically” means that the form of the representation – the sign –
itself is determined by the form of the thing it’s supposed to represent –
the signiﬁed.20 For example, a picture of a daisy is an icon of a daisy
because it looks like the thing it signiﬁes. Linguists sometimes call these
“motivated signs” because their form is determined by the thing they
signify – an iconic sign of a daisy must look like a daisy or it is not a
sign of a daisy at all.21 In contrast, the spoken word “daisy” is not an
icon of a daisy because it looks nothing like a daisy. In fact, because
it is a sound, it doesn’t “look” like anything at all. Linguists call these
“arbitrary signs” because there is no necessary relationship between the
sign and the thing it signiﬁes – the spoken word for a daisy could just
as well be “toaster.” When we encode sense data using arbitrary signs
like spoken words, a lot of information is lost. The experience of a
daisy is rich and full; the spoken word “daisy” does not reproduce that
experience. We have a saying that nicely captures this phenomenon: “A
picture’s worth a thousand words.”
Speech, then, is a low-ﬁdelity medium. What comes in – rich sense
data – is not what comes out – a one-channel code. It follows that
speech networks will be symbolic. In order to get on them and use
them, you will have to know the code. And the only thing you will
be able to send and receive will be symbols, arbitrary signs that must
be encoded and decoded. According to our theory, symbolic media
networks should conceptualize social practices and values that emerge
within them. Here, “conceptualized” means to make things observed
into abstract ideas. The reason is this: if humans are compelled to use
a mode of communication built on arbitrary signs, then they will begin
42

HOMO LOQUENS

to play with those signs and build systems of ideas out of them; speech
forces humans to use arbitrary signs.
We can see the process of conceptualization in our small speech
networks today. Naturally our family members, friends, and co-workers
are unique individuals with whom we interact – and therefore directly
sense – everyday. We see them and recognize that nobody looks like
them. They are who they are and nobody else. But the minute we speak
their names, we are engaged in the process of conceptualization. We
say that proper names refer exclusively to unique individuals. But they
almost never do. Something on the order of 15 million men around
the world carry a variation of the given name “Mohammed” today.22
Around 93 million Chinese bear the surname “Wang.”23 In 1990, there
were approximately 50,000 men named “John Smith” in the United
States.24 An identiﬁer such as “ID number 760399287654” can only
refer to one concrete thing; an abstract category like “Mohammed” can
refer to many things simultaneously. It follows that every spoken word
we use and understand, aside from unique IDs and some onomatopoeic
terms, is an abstraction deﬁned by tacit or explicit convention. To speak
is to abstract, to remove perception from its concrete time and place
and put it in conceptual buckets. It could have been no different for our
hunter-gatherer ancestors. They used general words to refer to different
things: the word “man” could refer to that man or any other; the word
“tree” to that tree or any other; the word “cloud” to that cloud or
any other. For them as for us, the generality of words raised a vexing
question: what is the epistemic status of words? They exist, but they
are not entirely of this world: you cannot sense “man,” “tree,” and
“cloud” in the same way you can that man, that tree, or that cloud.
Plato drew a reasonable conclusion, so reasonable that he could not
have been the ﬁrst and was certainly not the last to draw it: words,
he said, must come from some other “higher” world that we cannot
sense, a world of perfect abstract forms. When we use words, then,
we are interacting with that other, spiritual world – there was no way
around it.
The unavoidable abstraction of speech molded mores in prehistory
and, at least among some, continues to do so today in face-to-face speech
groups. The fact that social practices had to be abstracted needed to
be accommodated, and it was via idealism, the notion that the unseen
world – the world of ideas and spirits – was somehow more important
43

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

than the seen world. Since one used words to interact with the unseen
world, they had to be treated very carefully. Thus, hunter-gatherers
developed a code that governed how one could most effectively and
safely use them. Some things had to be said in order to ensure that
the unseen world remained favorably disposed to ours, for example,
prayers, incantations, and spells. Some things could not be said because
they would anger the residents of the unseen world, for example, curses,
blasphemies, and profanities. Elders were duty-bound to teach novices
the code and to make sure (or as sure as possible in an egalitarian
community) that everyone observed it as closely as possible. Those who
did so were deemed virtuous and would be rewarded; those who didn’t
were deemed wicked and would be punished. Though many people
today have come to believe, pace Plato, that words do not signal the
existence of a hidden sphere, many others do. Religious people still
hold to the notion that some things must be said and others must not
because words themselves are a kind of window to a higher sphere. And
the echo of this ritual behavior and the belief that stands behind it can
be seen even among non-religious people who observe a superstitious
avoidance of certain words and phrases. You don’t say “good luck” to
someone about to go on stage because it’s bad luck. Rather, you say
“Break a leg!”
Volume

On March 24, 2007, one Jaysimha Ravirala began a public lecture
titled “Personality Development Concepts” at the Federation of Andhra
Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Hyderabad, India. On
March 29, Mr. Ravirala concluded his remarks. His 120-hour speech
was the longest in history.25 It was probably the most annoying as
well. By all appearances, humans were not designed to send, receive, or
exchange spoken messages comprising approximately 500,000 words
and lasting ﬁve days. Actually, it’s hard to say with any certainty what
the maximum length of a practical spoken message is. It stands to
reason that it should be a function of: (1) the number of words we can
comfortably speak without getting a sore throat; and (2) the number
of words we can comfortably comprehend without “zoning out.” No
one knows either of these numbers, so no calculation can be made.

44

HOMO LOQUENS

That said, we can make a rough estimate based on the well-established
practice of limiting lectures to about 50 minutes. The logic here is that
if the 50-minute mark were signiﬁcantly sub-optimal – if speakers were
passing out and listeners were falling asleep – then it would have been
changed at some point in the last several hundred years. It hasn’t been. In
50 minutes, a ﬂuent speaker can produce 7,500 words talking at an easy
pace. If said lecturer is good, then she can hold the audience’s attention
for the duration but not much longer. That, then, is an approximation
of the upper bound, the largest a spoken message can practically be.
The lower bound is naturally one word. The vast majority of spoken
messages don’t fall in the middle, but rather are quite close to the
lower bound. In a typical conversation, you say several sentences –
tell a little story – and your interlocutor listens. Then you exchange
roles. Pretty soon, you both get tired. The conversation stops. In short,
most spoken messages are short. Now, the volume of information a
medium can carry is not only determined by the rate at which senders
can transmit data, but also by the number of people who receive –
or can receive – the message. When you say ten words to one person,
then you have communicated ten words. When you say ten words to
two people, you have communicated two sets of ten words, or twenty
words. In order to ﬁgure out what the capacity of speech is to transmit
information, we need to know how many people you can talk to at
once. We’ll deal with this question in more detail in a later section
(see “Range”), but the answer is approximately 800 without the aid
of any special technology, like an amphitheater or a megaphone. The
lower bound is usually considered one, but you can talk to yourself,
which would make it functionally zero. The average, again, falls toward
the lower bound: typically you speak with one or two people at a
time.
All of this means that the practical capacity of human speech to
transmit information is low. The messages we can conveniently send
and receive are short, and our ability to communicate them to others
is limited. Media with low capacity give rise to constrained networks,
that is, networks in which the rate of data transmission between nodes
is limited. According to our theory, constrained networks should economize social practices realized within and around them. Here “economize” means to promote spare, efﬁcient use of resources. The reason is

45

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

this: all things considered, constrained networks do not have the excess
capacity necessary for the gathering and transmission of non-essential
data; thus they are less likely to permit frivolous use. The network will
be used primarily for necessary communications, and only secondarily
for other sorts of activity.
This is the case in our small speech networks today. Since these networks can only accommodate comparatively light trafﬁc, most of their
capacity is taken up by essential tasks – maintenance of existing relationships, processing of routine business, and planning future activities.
In speech networks, talking is a means of organization, a way to get
things done, not generally a means of entertainment. That doesn’t mean,
of course, that it isn’t also a way to have fun. Humans enjoy talking,
and they will do it just for its own sake, particularly with familiars.
Nonetheless, most of the talking we do is instrumental – we use it to
make people do things like clean up the family room, order another
round at the bar, or ﬁnish the big project. Very rarely do we organize events that are speciﬁcally focused on live verbal fun, for example,
plays, poetry recitations, song fests or what have you. We have neither
the time, nor does speech have the surplus bandwidth, necessary to
allow us to do such things freely. It must have been the same among
hunter-gatherers long ago. Like us, they needed to maintain relationships, to process routine business, and to plan future activities. Unlike
us, all they had to do it with was speech, which, as we’ve said, doesn’t
really have high bandwidth. This constraint meant that they saw speech
as a tool, and a reasonably expensive one at that. When they had excess
capacity, they used speech for entertainment. But there wasn’t much
excess capacity. They understood that words had to be used sparingly,
for there weren’t that many of them.
The limited bandwidth of speech shaped values among huntergatherers and continues to do so today in intimate groups. The fact
that speech had to be used sparingly needed to be accommodated, and
it was via asceticism, the notion that the self develops through discipline. Thus, hunter-gatherers believed that words should be used in a
certain way, that there was a code of proper speaking. Those who spoke
well – were disciplined – were virtuous; those who spoke poorly – were
undisciplined – were not. We can see echoes of speech-asceticism in
the Classical World’s love of rhetoric, Plato notwithstanding. Then a

46

HOMO LOQUENS

person was judged by how they spoke, which is to say how well they
hewed to the code of proper speaking. We see a similar sort of thing
among family, friends, and in the workplace today. We often judge
our intimates by how they speak. Concision and eloquence are virtues;
verbosity and coarseness are vices. Nobody likes the “big mouth” or
the “foul mouth.”
Velocity

Speech is fast. How much time elapses between the moment you intend
to say something and the moment you say it, that is, between thought
and expression? According to physiologists, your brain ﬁres signals to
your body at a pace of something on the order of 300 feet per second.26
That’s about as fast as a typical Formula 1 race car. If the distance
from your brain’s language-processing regions to your vocal apparatus
is roughly six inches, then the typical lag between a really compelling
thought like “Marry me!” and the utterance of the exclamation “Marry
me!” is going to be about 1/600th of a second. Of course, you don’t
have to immediately say everything you think, and it’s probably advisable that you don’t. Once “Marry me!” emerges, we confront another
question: How much time elapses between the moment you speak it
and the moment your words reach your beloved? Physicists have proposed an answer. They say that words ﬂy out of your mouth at 1,128
feet per second, depending on atmospheric conditions.27 That’s about
the velocity of a typical riﬂe bullet. If your intended is three feet away
(closer would be better), then your proposal will reach her in around
1/376th of a second. In much less than a blink of an eye (between onetenth and three-tenths of a second),28 you have gone from hanging out
to getting hitched. Or not.
There is no doubt, then, that speech is a high-velocity medium. Combine speech’s speed with its low cost (see “Accessibility”), and it’s easy
to see that the networks built with it will be thoroughly dialogic. If both
senders and recipients can produce, dispatch, and comprehend messages
in an instant, and it costs virtually nothing to do so, there is every reason
to expect a rapid exchange of messages, that is, dialogue. According
to our theory, dialogic networks should democratize the social practices that are realized in and around them. Here “democratize” means

47

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

encouraging broadly deliberative and consensual decision making. The
reason is this: if humans are given a low-cost opportunity to exchange
opinions about any important matter, they usually will; dialogic networks afford them this opportunity.
Again, witness our small speech networks today. They are generally
run – if not ofﬁcially organized – along democratic lines. The family
head, leader of the pack, or boss can make decisions by ﬁat, but he or she
would be well advised not to do so. Best to discuss important issues until
some rough consensus – or the face-saving appearance of consensus – is
reached. Early human bands probably operated in the same way. There
was no getting around the fact that members could and would discuss
things of common interest – they could not be stopped, at least at a
bearable cost. This meant that the easiest way to organize any collective
activity was to deliberate to the point of consensus. Democratization
did not mean that everything was discussed all the time. Indeed, much
had already been decided and was enshrined in tradition. But even the
social practice of tradition was democratized insofar as the status of
something as “traditional” was always open to debate and likely to
be debated. In such a context, negotiation was the way things were
accomplished.
The velocity and therefore dialogicity of speech had a deﬁnite impact
on the mores of hunter-gatherers and so it does today in small speech
networks. The fact that everyone was able to engage in a rapid-ﬁre backand-forth needed to be accommodated, and it was via deliberativism,
the idea that everyone should speak for themselves and that opinions
should be equally weighted. There were justiﬁable exceptions: the Big
Man would sometimes decide himself, and his words would generally
have more weight than the Little Man’s. But in most instances it was
deemed proper that things be discussed by adult members of the band
as a whole. Gods could dictate; men had to talk. Roughly the same
tacit ethical code operates in our small groups today. As family members, friends, and co-workers, we generally agree that things should be
discussed more or less democratically in the normal course of affairs.
There are still justiﬁable exceptions: your superior sometimes “makes
the call,” meaning what she says matters more than what you say.
Nonetheless, we hold that surveying opinion and working toward consensus is the right thing to do in most instances. If you think otherwise,
you are quite likely to be called “bossy.”
48

Range

It’s true that voices carry, so you have to watch what you say. But in
point of fact they don’t carry very far, so you needn’t be that careful.
Imagine you are talking to a colleague in your workplace in a normal
voice at a distance of three feet. You don’t have to raise your voice
and she doesn’t have to strain to hear. Now imagine that you triple
the distance between the two of you, making the gap nine feet. Because
sound intensity decays quickly as it travels through the atmosphere,
your six-foot retreat reduces the objective power of the sound reaching
her by nine times.29 But that doesn’t mean she perceives your words
as one-ninth as loud. If that were so, she couldn’t really hear you, and
clearly she can. In fact, from her perspective, your voice is roughly half as
loud as it was at three feet. The reason changes in sound intensity are not
matched one-to-one by changes in perceived loudness is evolutionary. In
order to survive, our ancestors needed to register an enormous range of
sonic signals, from very weak ones to very strong ones. To accommodate
this range, natural selection designed the auditory system to compensate
for huge swings in sonic power: the system steps-up soft signals to
make them audible and steps-down powerful ones to make them safe.
Thus, we can comfortably listen to a mosquito and a rock concert
even though the sonic intensity of the former is one-billionth that of
the latter. A band is louder than a buzzing insect, but it’s not one
billion times as loud. The practitioners of psycho-acoustics have devised
a rule for relating movements in sound intensity and loudness: each
10-point shift in decibels changes loudness by a factor of two, that is,
doubles it or halves it.30 Doubling the distance between you and your
colleague resulted in a reduction of 10 decibels in sound intensity from
her perspective; hence the sound is half as loud. You are still audible
and perhaps even understandable, but softer. Now imagine that you
triple the distance once more, that is, move from nine feet away to
27 feet away. That reduces the strength of your signal by nine times
again and results in a further 10-decibel drop. Again the loudness of
your voice from your interlocutor’s perspective is cut in half, making it
one-quarter as audible as it was when you were three feet away. Since
the ambient noise in a quiet ofﬁce can easily exceed 40 decibels31 –
approximately the intensity with which your words strike your coworker’s ear – you can no longer be heard. It’s time to raise your
49

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

voice. Most healthy adults shout at about 80 decibels, though screams
can break 115 decibels.32 If you begin to shout at 80 decibels, your
words will strike your co-worker’s ear 27 feet way at about 60 decibels.
So you are right back where you started, though you are annoying
your colleagues and ruining your throat. But you are a glutton for
punishment. You triple the distance between you and her again. You
are 81 feet way (you’ve got a big ofﬁce), your words strike her with a
force of about 50 decibels, and are half as loud as they were when you
were 27 feet away. She can hear you, and sort of make out what you
are shouting. She shouts back that she wants you to stop yelling. But
you proceed with your bizarre experiment and again triple the distance.
Now you are 243 feet way from her (let’s say you work in an airplane
hangar), your words hit her at around 40 decibels, and are half as loud
as they were when you were 81 feet away. Once again you’ve reached
the point at which ambient noise has canceled your signal. She can’t
hear you, particularly over the sound of your boss threatening to ﬁre
you. Besides, your voice is shot.
Because the range of the human voice is short, so is its practical
reach. Reach is the number of people within range of a message. The
unaided voice is a broadcast medium, meaning its signal moves over an
area like a radio wave rather than from point to point like a telephone
line. The shape of the area covered by a voice is really conical in that
it begins at a point of origin and expands along two axes. Think of a
conical megaphone that goes on and on. To simplify matters, however,
let’s just say that the voice expands in all directions, that is, radiates.
Let’s also say that you can shout intelligibly at 50 feet. Given these two
assumptions, your voice can potentially be heard by anyone standing
not more than 50 feet away from you in any direction. Your physical
reach, then, is a circle with an area of 7,854 square feet. This sounds
like a lot, but it’s not. The highest crowd density humans can sustain
without injury is about two square feet per person, about what you
experience in a very crowded elevator.33 At that rate, subtracting your
two square feet, your reach would theoretically be 3,926 people. But
practically that level could never be obtained, ﬁrst because crowds are
noisy and second because it would not take long for the ﬁrst ﬁght to
break out. A much more reasonable allotment of space would be 10
square feet per person, about what you experience in a “loose crowd.”34
Then your reach would be only 784 people. But even an audience of
50

HOMO LOQUENS

that size will be difﬁcult to hold for long. Remember, you are yelling
and they need to eat, drink, and use the facilities. It’s no wonder that
most speeches come in well under an hour.
Speech, then, is a short-range medium with small reach. It’s just not
effective beyond about 20 or 30 feet, the point at which you begin
to have to shout to be understood. Cries, shrieks, and screams can be
heard at greater distances – perhaps up to a half mile in the right conditions – but all you can say is “Arrrrrrgh!” and that’s not much. Media
with short range generally give rise to intensive networks. According to
our theory, intensive networks should simplify social practices. Here,
“simplify” means to make different things the same. The reason is this:
people in focused networks are less likely to encounter unfamiliar people, things, and ideas. The world of the intensive network will not be
completely uniform, but neither will it be as diverse as that engendered
by an extensive network.
Social practices in modern speech networks are simpliﬁed in just this
way. You tend to know the people you can and do talk to regularly.
They are like you, or will probably become like you (or you like them)
if you continue to interact with them. The boundaries of the “known”
are surprisingly rigid: for reasons probably having to do with the natural human fear of strangers, you don’t tend to talk to people you don’t
already know. Talking to strangers is hard work, and getting to know
them is harder still. So most people avoid it and “stick to their own,”
at least as far as talking is concerned. Naturally you have many relationships outside the family, circle of friends, and workplace based on
“weak ties.” If you are an outgoing person, these weak relationships
might be many, but for most people – especially if they live in an alltalking environment – they will be few and weak indeed. All this was
probably the case for early humans living in hunter-gatherer bands. The
members of the band talked to one another – people like themselves –
and rarely encountered anyone who wasn’t already known. When they
met strangers, they probably feared them as they had had little experience dealing with people not like themselves. A long-range medium
might have afforded them the opportunity to learn of people different
from themselves. But they had none.
In both the hunter-gatherer band and the modern intimate circle, short range and limited reach shaped values. The fact that the
known universe was small needed to be accommodated, and it was via
51

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

monism, the notion that there is only one kind of person – yours –
and one kind of thing – those around you. In that world, there was no
“us” and “them”: there was only “us.” To be sure, hunter-gatherers
encountered “different” people and things. But they did not recognize
them as such. Rather, they either assimilated them to “us” or rejected
their status as people or things, that is, classiﬁed them as “strangers.”
If determined to be the latter, then they could only be dangerous and
should therefore be avoided. We see a similar sort of mentality in operation in our small speech groups. Our “us” – the family, circle of friends,
co-workers – is strictly demarked from everything that is “non-us.”
Those who fall into the category of “non-us” are not “them” (a group
known and different) but “strangers” (a group unknown and different).
And everyone knows that you shouldn’t talk to strangers.
Persistence

In general, the earth’s atmosphere is a poor slate on which to record
information. It’s full of clouds, buffeted by winds, and periodically
wiped clean by rain. The best anyone has ever come up with is skywriting, which uses the air to suspend what are really just elaborate
smoke signals. Truth be told, skywriting is good for advertisements but
worthless for data storage. But even humble skywriting is superior to
speech as a storage medium, for spoken words instantly “vanish into
thin air.” You say something and a moment later every external trace
of it is gone. You can’t see it, hear it, smell it, taste it, or touch it. All
you can do is remember it. Alas, as a device for recording experience,
memory has deﬁnite limits. First of all, memory is small. Short-term
memory is especially tiny. According to one oft-cited study, it can grasp
between ﬁve and nine elements and hold them for roughly 20 seconds.35
Then said elements disappear, unless, that is, they make it into longterm memory. Most don’t. Shifting things from short-term to long-term
memory is hard work. Ask anyone cramming for an exam. We don’t
know the capacity of long-term memory, but it certainly has an upper
bound. By one estimate, adult humans typically have on the order of
100 megabytes of learned data stored in their memories.36 A typical
CD holds 650 megabytes. Second, memory is low ﬁdelity. Imagine you
see a tree. Photons reﬂected from the tree strike the rods and cones in
your eyes; your eyes send them to the brain as electrical impulses; your
52

HOMO LOQUENS

brain then stores them as neural networks. Seems simple, but it’s not. In
essence, the “tree” has been translated from photons to electrons and
from electrons to neurons. Moreover, at each translation the amount
of data in the photonic image has been radically reduced. It’s as if you
translated the original Russian version of War and Peace into English
as “A big book about war by a Russian.” A half million Russian words
have been reduced to eight English words. Memory encodes and compresses everything in this way. It doesn’t store pictures; it stores gists.
Gists are remarkable. They are extraordinarily well addressed and can
store any kind of sensation. That means you can easily call up the gist
of the tree you saw, and it might well contain data about the way the
tree looked, sounded, and smelled. The problem arises when you want
to share your experience of the tree with someone. The only way you
can do that is to translate the neural gist into speech. That deﬁnitely
means another encoding and probably means more compression. Thus,
a verbal description of a tree is at least three removes from the tree
itself: photons to electrons (perception), electrons to neurons (memory), neurons to words (recall and speech). At each moment, the data
are translated into a different medium and thinned out. It’s no wonder
that a poem has never been as lovely as a tree, for the word “tree”
doesn’t sound anything like a tree looks. Finally, memory is impermanent. From the moment we are born, we are constantly forgetting
things. There’s a common if confusing expression that goes “I’ve forgotten more than I ever knew.” Whatever it means, it’s certainly true that
at an early age the sum of things most people have forgotten exceeds
the things they have ever known at any given point in time. To say that
the memory is like a sieve is to insult sieves.
So speech is not persistent. It neither remains ﬂoating around in the
air nor ﬁrmly ﬁxed in memory. Media that are not persistent should
encourage the formation of substitutive networks, that is, ones in which
new data supplant old data because the total amount of data that can be
archived is severely constrained. According to our theory, substitutive
networks should ritualize social practices realized within and around
them. Here, “ritualize” means to use the form of expression to store
content. The reason is this: people in substitutive networks have limited
means to ﬁx new content, and therefore must employ mnemonic devices
such as rhyme, meter, rhythm, and behavioral routines to do so. Raw
memory just won’t do the job, and there is no way to record anything in
53

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

an external medium because there are none. Therefore, the data are, so
to say, inscribed in actions that can be easily repeated. The past exists
as behavior in the present.
Evidence of ritualization is apparent in our speech networks today.
The daily interactions of family members, friends, co-workers, and
strangers are full of routines that preserve valuable information and
thereby free up memory for more important stuff. Some of them must
be acted out, as in the case of appropriate comportment: how to greet
someone (handshaking, embraces, salutes), how to look at them (sometimes in the eye, sometimes not), how far to stand from them (close but
not too close). Others are spoken, as in the case of clichés expressing
regret (“Excuse me”), sorrow (“Bummer”), joy (“Great”), appreciation (“Thank you”), and so on. We never have to think when using
these devices: we simply recognize the situation in which they are to be
performed and perform them. We just don’t have the memory capacity (or patience) to think of what to do or say every time we are in
one of these stereotyped contexts, and we certainly don’t have the
time to record what we did or said in every such situation so we can
look back on it and adjust it for the next interaction. Now imagine
what it must have been like for early humans without any means of
recording information outside their nearly zero-sum memories. They
would have to capture everything of real value in some sort of ritual that could be more or less “automatically” performed. Not just
the niceties of interpersonal relations, but everything – how to hunt,
gather, cook, eat, clean, sew, travel, camp, marry, name the young,
heal the sick, bury the dead, and worship the spirits. Some of this could
be entrusted to raw memory. But memory faded, and the rememberers
died. So all this vital information had to be preserved by incorporation in
rituals.
The constraint of memory and the necessity of ritualization shaped
the mores of hunter-gatherers and continues to do so in face-to-face
speech communities. The fact that very little could be recorded needed
to be accommodated, and it was via eternalism, the notion that things
have always been basically as they are. In this world, time was not very
linear. Of course there was a “before now,” “now,” and “after now.”
But there was no well-elaborated idea of a continuous, knowable pastpresent-future. Neither was time very cyclical. Naturally the same kinds

54

HOMO LOQUENS

of things happened over and over – the sun rose and set, the rains came
and went, people were born and then died. But everyone knew that they
really weren’t the same things, because things changed. The important
point is, however, that they didn’t generally change very much, or rather
that there was little evidence that they changed very much. This is why
the rituals always worked, and why they had to be protected, preserved,
and performed correctly. Life depended on it. People today seem to be
much more practical, and many dismiss “empty ritual” as a waste of
time. Nonetheless, our direct interactions with family members, friends,
and co-workers are highly ritualized, and we hold fast to the notion that
we should observe these rituals even if we don’t call them such. Intimates
who routinely violate the code of established, routinized comportment
are thought of in harsh terms. They are “thoughtless,” “insensitive,”
and “rude.” Such people, we say, “just don’t know how to act” and
therefore are “difﬁcult to deal with.”
Searchability

As we just said, words appear (that is, are audible) and vanish very
quickly. Alas, they leave virtually no trace in the primary propagating
medium – the atmosphere – and only a slight and ﬂeeting hint in secondary propagating media – for example, a vibrating window pane.
Sound waves deﬂect, so if you are in the right acoustical environment –
say, a canyon – then they might rapidly come back to you once or twice
as echoes. Other than that, they are gone forever. The evanescence of
speech is important because it means that speech – or rather the primary
medium in which speech is propagated – does not store words and therefore cannot be searched. In an all-talking environment, your memory is
the only storage device available (aside from rituals; see “Persistence”)
and thus the only one that can be searched. Fortunately, memory is
very searchable for a number of reasons. First, searching memory is
cheap and almost always possible. If you are healthy, it costs you virtually nothing to search your memory. Short of knocking you out, it’s
hard to prevent you from conducting a mental search. Second, you not
only have the ability to search your own memory, but also everyone
else’s you can talk to. Just ask them if they remember something and,
if you are nice, they will probably tell you. If they refuse, you can try

55

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

to persuade them, likely with mixed results. Third, searching memory
is fast. In fact, it’s usually almost instantaneous: you see something and
it immediately reminds you of something related. Accessing someone
else’s memory may be a bit slower, as you have to ask permission to
conduct the search or, if they rebuff your request, try to persuade them.
Fourth, memory’s search function is very responsive. If the mind holds
a bit of information, then the memory can precisely and rapidly retrieve
not only just the right bit, but also all the bits that are related to it. The
human memory’s address system is remarkably ﬂexible and efﬁcient.
So speech is not searchable at all. Memory, however, is quite searchable. Searchable media, like memory, give rise to mapped networks.
Assuming a certain degree of comity in a human group, each node
(person) will make his or her storage and search capacities (memories)
available to every other node, rendering the data therein visible to all.
By the lights of our theory, mapped media networks should amateurize
social practices. Here, “amateurize” means empowering the individual
to do things independently, in this instance to look for and get information. The reason is this: since everyone in effect knows or can easily
ﬁnd out everything, everyone is an expert in everything, which is to say
there are no experts, only amateurs.
We see this in intimate speech communities today. In the family,
circle of friends, and workplace, we all do basically the same things,
or at least a small set of different things everyone can see and is familiar with. Therefore, we know a lot of the same things. That which we
don’t all know is shared, so that everyone is “on the same page.” Thus,
everyone knows most everything important. Everyone is an expert, so
no one is an expert. Such was probably the case with early human communities living in talking-only environments, only more so. In order
for there to be unequal access to information, there has to be unequal
distribution of information. Members of hunter-gatherer bands, however, all had similar experiences and therefore knew roughly the same
things. Information was evenly distributed, at least compared to the era
that followed (see Chapter 2). Naturally, different sorts of knowledge
clustered in certain groups – elders knew things adolescents didn’t, men
knew things women didn’t (and vice versa), and Big Men knew things
Little Men didn’t. But in comparison to the vast ﬁeld of common knowledge shared by the entire band, these differences were minor. Thus, it

56

HOMO LOQUENS

was difﬁcult to use knowledge as a basis for special status, at least in the
long run. The primary exception would be the Wise Man. He claimed
special, esoteric knowledge and used this claim as a basis for superior
status. But even his position was not unassailable. In an oral environment, any declaration of esoteric wisdom could be challenged, as almost
everyone had the ability and right to question anyone else. Moreover,
even if the Wise Man survived a barrage of probing queries, he would
be required to use his esoterica for the good of the group. This put
him in a bind. If he refused, then the band would not grant him special
expert status. If he complied, then he had to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of
his knowledge. What if he failed? What if his special knowledge proved
useless? Again, the band would not grant him elevated status and might
even call him a fraud. In early human communities, then, knowledge
and status did not clump. Rather, they spread out among the members
of the band, all of whom had some claim on them.
The fact that memory is highly searchable had a profound impact on
hunter-gatherer values, as it does at present in intimate speech groups.
The fact that knowledge was accessible to all accommodated, and it was
via individualism, the idea that each person should be autonomous.
Since everyone knew almost everything, and that which they didn’t
know they could ﬁnd out, everyone knew all that was needed to live:
how to hunt, how to cook, how to sew, how to pray, and so on.
Any real person would know these things; if you did not, then your
personhood was in doubt. People who were needlessly dependent on
others were looked down upon. We see a similar ethic among intimate
groups today. We share information freely with our family members,
friends, and co-workers, and we expect them to be independent. Of
course we would “do anything” for them, but we don’t want to have
to do it regularly. If we have to, then they run the risk of being called a
“mooch.”

In the nineteenth century, gentlemen-scholars were casting about for an
omnibus name for the early human artifacts they had recently uncovered. They settled on “prehistoric,” meaning “of the era before written
history.”37 The choice was a sort of admission that their task – the
reconstruction of human life from the moment Homo sapiens appeared

57

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

to the emergence of writing – would be a difﬁcult one. How, after all,
do you write the history of people who could not write and left nothing
but a scattered few mute artifacts in their wake? Over the past century,
archeologists and anthropologists have offered many answers to this
question, most of which focus on the detailed analysis of the ancient
artifacts themselves as well as investigations of contemporary huntergatherers. We have offered another answer, one that focuses precisely
on the fact that early humans were “prehistoric,” that is, could not
write.
Our thesis is that speech and memory shaped the way ancient huntergatherers lived in predictable ways, just as it does in our modern oral
groups. Then and now, speech and memory had inherent physical
attributes. Then and now, the attributes of speech and memory fostered
talking networks. Then and now, talking networks promoted certain
social practices and values. Table 2 sums up the entire theory as it concerns the impact of speech and memory on ancient hunter-gatherers and
modern intimate circles alike.
It’s important to note that speech and memory don’t necessarily foster the social practices and values listed, or when they do, foster them
in the same degree. They simply tend to produce them most of the
time at some level. In fact, we can and do diminish or even completely
override the natural tendencies of speech and memory at times, though
only with great effort. Consider, for example, the military. Like any
other large organization, the military is divided up into smaller working groups such as staff ofﬁces, combat units, and special details. Here

everyone works face-to-face and the primary mode of communication is
talking. Under normal conditions, this fact would push military working groups in the direction predicted by our theory – members would
begin treating each other as equals, knowledge would be shared, and
decision making would be democratized. But the military cannot allow
this to happen, for its work requires ever-present hierarchy, need-toknow secrecy, and to-the-letter obedience even in face-to-face contexts.
In essence, the military has to foster social practices and values that run
against the grain of the media environment in which they are realized. It
does this by imposing a strict – and profoundly unnatural – behavioral
code on face-to-face interaction. The code covers both gestures (salutes,
standing at attention) and speech (use of honoriﬁcs like “sir,” speaking
only when addressed by a superior). It applies both to upward communication (from inferior to superior) and downward communication
(from superior to inferior). The intention of all these rules is to ensure
that inferiors do not refuse the commands of superiors and superiors
do not treat inferiors “like brothers,” that is, fraternize. The military –
and not only the military, but many “total institutions”38 – knows
that in the absence of these strange, punitive rules, that is exactly what
would happen. It’s the natural course of things in predominantly oral
groups.
Among our ancient ancestors, however, nature took its course. Thus,
band members treated each other as equals and believed equality was
proper. They communicated openly and held that knowledge was common property. They valued disciplined speech. They discussed common
affairs and proclaimed that it was right to do so. They were similar
one to another and understood conformity to be a good thing. They
practiced many rituals and esteemed those who performed them correctly. They were autonomous in the sense that they could all do what
needed to be done themselves, and they prized this autonomy greatly.
Though we have arrived at this picture by considering the impact of
speech and memory on contemporary intimate communities and reasoning back to hunter-gatherers, it is by and large supported by the
work of paleoanthropologists.39
This, then, was Talking Culture, the product in large measure of
talking itself. It was the most robust and productive media culture
we’ve ever known, surviving basically unchanged for approximately

59

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

175,000 years and enabling Homo sapiens to populate nearly the entire
globe. But nothing lasts forever. In the next chapter we will see how
a peculiarly common set of circumstances placed burdens on Talking
Culture that it could not bear, or rather bear alone. The result was
the emergence of a new medium – writing – and with it Manuscript
Culture.

homo scriptor
Humanity in the Age of Manuscripts

If men learn [writing], it will implant forgetfulness in their souls: they will cease
to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to
remembrance no longer from within themselves.1
– Plato, Phaedrus, 275A

In Plato’s time and place – Greece circa 400 BC – neither philosophy nor
writing was particularly new. Understood in the generic sense of asking
big questions, the former was as ancient as humanity itself. Understood
in the sense of encoding spoken language, writing was already 2,500
years old. But the use of writing to practice philosophy was novel in
Plato’s day, and it was an open question as to whether the medium was
up to the task. Plato didn’t think so. He found the same fault with writing as he found with spoken rhetoric: neither allowed dialogue, the only
means by which one could ﬁnd the Truth. Like so many rhetorically
adept politicians, written words “talk to you as though they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything about what they say, from a desire
to be instructed, they go on telling you just the same thing for ever”
(Phaedrus, 275D). Such monologues – spoken or written – were not only
tedious, they were also the enemies of true understanding. But writing,
Plato said, was worse than rhetoric, for it not only mislead people, it
also made them pretentious fools. By “telling [readers] of many things
without teaching them,” Plato wrote, “[written words] will make them
seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing; and as
men ﬁlled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will
be a burden to their fellows” (Phaedrus, 275A). Writing’s potential for
causing harm was made greater by the fact that it separated speaker and
speech. “Once a thing is put in writing, the composition, whatever it
61

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

may be, drifts all over the place, getting into the hands not only of those
who understand it, but equally of those who have no business with
it; it doesn’t know how to address the right people, and not address
the wrong people” (Phaedrus, 275D). From Plato’s point of view, this
sort of wandering was unacceptable. In a dialogic context, philosophers
can ﬁght back against unwarranted attacks. But once their words are
captured in writing, they cannot. The mute text is “unable to defend
or help itself” (Phaedrus, 275D). For all these reasons, Plato said, “no
intelligent man will ever be so bold as to put into language those things
which his reason has contemplated, especially not into a form that is
unalterable, which must be the case with what is expressed in written
symbols” (Epistle VII, 343).2 It’s little wonder, then, that Plato makes
no provision for the teaching of writing in The Republic.
It may seem paradoxical that Plato, enemy of supposed philosophic
writing, wrote all this down. But it really isn’t. True to his conviction
that any form of monologue stunted intellectual development, he wrote
dialogues. Others, however, were not so wise, and ﬁrst among them
were the rhetorically trained pseudo-statesmen he so despised. And why
did they write their long, ﬂowery speeches? The same reason they spoke
them – for the sake of power and fame. To them, the written word was
not a means to the Truth, but rather a tool of manipulation. As we will
see, Plato was not wrong here. In the hands of elites, writing proved to
be one of the most effective instruments of power ever invented. Rulers
could not stop people from talking, but they could control writing, and
with it meaning. The result was the end of the hunter-gather band and
the birth of the kind of hierarchical societies with which we are all so
familiar today.

why we write
In order to demonstrate that our “pull” theory of media evolution is
correct in the case of manuscript-writing, we need to establish the truth
of two propositions. First, we must show that the technical capacity
to write preexisted writing by some signiﬁcant period of time. If we
ﬁnd this to be the case, then we can conclude that people could have
written but did not because demand for writing was too low. Second,
we must show that some macro-historical shift made existing media –
gesture and talking – insufﬁcient for the purposes of some organized
62

HOMO SCRIPTOR

groups, and that this or these groups engineered a preexisting technical
capacity – the ability to write – into a new medium.
What evidence, primary and secondary, can be brought to bear on
these two propositions? As we saw, early Speech Cultures left very little
to us and therefore we had to rely on an inferential method. In contrast,
Manuscript Cultures left much more to us and thus we can rest our
conclusions on a ﬁrm base of primary sources. True, these sources are
few in the beginning, but they grow in number and richness as time
goes on. Quite fortunately, they have been mined, sifted, and assayed
by generations of scholars studying writing and reading in the Ancient
Near East,3 Classical Antiquity,4 and medieval Europe,5 that is, roughly
the period 3500 BC to AD 1450. In all that follows we will rely on their
work in testing our two theories.
Writing before Writing

We couldn’t write until recently. But we clearly could have. It’s possible that Homo erectus and certain that early Homo sapiens possessed
the core capacity that stands behind all writing – the ability to associate
graphic signs with thoughts, that is, to symbolize. We know this because
both species were similar anatomically to us and, more directly, because
they made symbols, or what look a lot like symbols. Some 300,000
years ago our ancestors apparently collected pieces of red ochre; we
might reasonably guess that they used these early crayons for some
symbolic purpose.6 What that purpose was no one has been able to
determine. About the same time, someone carved a rather nice minimalist design into an ox rib.7 Like minimalist art today, no one can
ﬁgure out what it means. Shells with holes bored in them dating back
approximately 100,000 years ago have been found, evidently to be used
as ornaments.8 Doubtless they were fetching. There is ample evidence
of symbolic production between 40,000 and 30,000 years ago, including beads, etchings, carvings, paintings, and burials.9 The earliest of
the famous French cave paintings, for example, come from this time
or a bit later.10 For the most part they are straightforwardly representational, depicting animals and humans, often in the process of killing
one another.
So proto-humans and early humans could use things as symbols,
but they apparently didn’t need to very often. That started to change
63

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

about 20,000 years ago.11 The earth was then at the height of one of its
periodic glaciations, meaning it was cold and dry. Things were not good
for Homo sapiens, who generally prefers warm and wet. Happily, the
globe gradually began to get warmer and the glaciers began to recede.
But the good times didn’t really start until around 14,500 years ago,
when the pace of warming increased signiﬁcantly. Warmth means more
energy in the biosphere; more energy in the biosphere generally means
more ﬂora and fauna; and more ﬂora and fauna generally mean happier
hunting grounds. So it was that about 12,800 years ago, a new kind
of human culture began to emerge – the Natuﬁan.12 The Natuﬁans did
something no other hunter-gatherers had ever done as far as we know:
they settled down, or almost settled down. Apparently things were so
good in their homeland – the Jordan River valley – that they stopped
their ceaseless migrations from one food source to another and built
permanent villages. They ﬁgured, “Why go to the food when the food
will come to you?” These were popular sentiments, for the settlement
movement spread. Today we ﬁnd the remnants of the Natuﬁans’ little
round huts, ﬁre pits, bone piles (they clearly favored gazelles), and the
faint traces of an astounding number of edible plants scattered over
much of the Levant.
But it couldn’t last. The earth being ﬁckle, it suddenly got colder and
dryer in an event climatologists mysteriously call the “Younger Dryas.”
From 11,500 to 10,300 years ago, times were hard for the Natuﬁans.
The food didn’t come to them as it had, so most of them pulled up
their stakes and returned to their wandering ways. Others, however,
having grown fond of life in settlements, didn’t fancy moving. They
tried to stick it out by eating less appetizing things (like bugs) and,
more importantly, by making food. We really don’t know how they
came to produce food in a systematic way. All hunter-gatherers lived
with and off wild ﬂora and fauna – grasses, fruits, nuts, tubers, and
game of every variety. They knew a lot about them, more than we can
probably imagine. One of the things they knew was that if you gather
seeds and broadcast them – as they regularly did – nice edible plants
will grow all on their own. They also knew that certain animals – like
wolves – would just follow you around. To us, the leap from these facts
to agriculture and animal husbandry seems small. To them it was huge.
Who, after all, would trade the life of the open ﬁeld for one that revolved
around digging in the dirt among ﬁlthy animals, not to mention having
64

HOMO SCRIPTOR

to live cheek-by-jowl with strangers? Moreover, there was no guarantee
that such a mode of production would succeed. No one, after all, had
ever tried it. It’s not like you could run down to the model farm and see
the new food production methods in glorious practice. Risk aversion
was a smart play, as 170,000 years of experience showed.
The successors of the Natuﬁans, the Neolithic farmers, eased into
the new sedentary, food-producing way of life just to hedge their risk.13
They began with a hybrid heavily favoring the old ways and, as ﬂora
and fauna domestication proved reliable, shifted their energies toward
agriculture and animal raising. It may have been their skill, ingenuity, and perseverance that made it all work. Or it may have been the
weather: beginning around 10,300 years ago, the earth’s climate entered
the “Holocene,” a period of sustained warm and wet conditions that
continues to this day (with a little help from us).14 Wheat, barley, peas,
lentils, and ﬂax were domesticated around 9,500 years ago.15 Within
1,000 years, goats, sheep, pigs, and cattle had been brought to heel.16
As environmental conditions improved and news of domestication techniques spread, Neolithic farming migrated rapidly all over the Levant.
Permanent villages of between 300 and 500 people became reasonably
common.17 Some of them – like Jericho, founded about 9,600 years
ago – are still inhabited today.
These early Neolithic agricultural villages were in essence immobilized hunter-gatherer bands. But they couldn’t be just that, for sedentary
village life changed social organization in signiﬁcant ways. On the range,
the band generally held everything in common. No one owned the land
or its resources. It was just there to be exploited. “Exploited” seems
just the right word, for despite common myths to the contrary, huntergatherers do not – or at least did not – care much for conservation.
Judging from the fact that hunting by proto-humans and early humans
seems to have been responsible for the decimation of numerous faunal
species, our ancestors never gave much thought to husbanding natural
resources.18 If it was around and made of meat, they killed it and ate
it. Indeed, their rapacious carnivorousness in this regard was probably
evolutionarily adaptive insofar as hunting on the savannah was a feastor-famine affair. When the gazelle were running, you would do well
to eat as many as possible because they weren’t going to be running
for long. Agriculture, however, is an entirely different game. Instead of
killing and collecting food from a vast, divinely given pool, you have to
65

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

breed it on a discrete plot of land or with a deﬁnite group of animals.
Your labor – not somebody else’s – gets invested. On the savannah, the
sky lord grants you a good hunt; in the wheat ﬁeld or pig sty, you reap
what you sow.
This difference altered relations between families in the band. In the
agricultural village, families had an economic incentive to pull out of
the traditional resource-sharing scheme, proclaim their property private, and go it alone under the protection of tribal elders. Having hived
off the band, the family was free to engage in independent, selﬁsh,
growth-oriented economic activity. It became a “household,” a familialeconomic unit, indeed one of the most durable in human history. It’s
still with us today. Interestingly, we can see when the transition from the
band to the village cum collection of households occurred in the architectural footprints of successive cultural levels in early Levant villages.19
The Natuﬁans, as we’ve said, built round huts suitable for two people (a
married couple) or one (an uncle, or grandfather). The early Neolithic
farmers did the same about 10,000 years ago. But as their settlements
grew over the next millennium, their dwellings became larger, rectilinear, and multi-roomed. These houses were for families and extended
families: mom, dad, the kids, more distant relatives, and perhaps domestics. Signiﬁcantly, storage facilities for grain begin to appear, suggesting
the emergence of the family as an independent residential and economic
unit. We also see the erection of the ﬁrst public buildings, evidence of
the rise of a common life and perhaps hierarchy on the level of the
village.
“Pulling” Writing into Existence

These early public buildings are important for our story, because it
was probably in them that the ﬁrst true system of symbols in human
history developed. The collective spirit of the band was not completely
lost when the shift to agriculture and the emergence of households
occurred. The Neolithic farmers still needed to cooperate, particularly in
the production of public goods such as leadership, security, and spiritual
care. These things were essential for the prosperity of every family, but
no single family could provide them. There was no choice, really, but
to create new public institutions to serve these functions and to pay for
them collectively (though not necessarily equitably). Language enabled
66

them to do the former, and the existence of an economic surplus enabled
them to do the latter. Now, we should not think that this was some sort
of early ﬂowering of the democratic spirit. The Neolithic farmers may
have composed some sort of social contract, or they may have been
forced into an “arrangement” by some powerful family. In a sense, it
doesn’t really matter how they came to team up. The point is that if
they failed to do so, by whatever means, they would probably perish.
Whether formed by compact or coercion, the new order had two
important and novel consequences: social ranks and taxes. The former
were held by princes and priests who supplied the aforementioned public goods, and the latter were levied from the beneﬁciaries of these goods.
It was exactly in this context that humans ﬁrst found good reason to
make symbols systematically. That reason was to keep accounts. Princes
and priests needed to record who had contributed what to the treasury
and how much the treasury contained. Unaided memory wouldn’t really
do. As we pointed out, memory is good at boiling down information
into gists. Typically, the mind reduces complex quantitative information to simple categories like one, two, and many. Keeping accounts
in terms of one, two, and many is an invitation to disaster. Something
much more exact was needed, namely, numerals: not one, two, many,
but 24, 25, and 26. Alas, the Neolithic farmers had none. And even if
they did, numerals alone wouldn’t help much with the task at hand,
because the memory doesn’t store numerals well. You might be able to
remember that one family deposited 26 bushels of wheat in the granary,
but you couldn’t remember the exact quantities that multiple families
deposited, at least for long.
What the Neolithic people needed, and indeed all they could create
without numbers, was a system of counting in which one physical symbol represented one physical item. In a word, they needed a token. And
this is precisely what they created.20 Being slothful, they “re-purposed”
an old technology to do the job rather than inventing a new one. Craftsmen had been making clay trinkets for thousands of years. These could
also be used as tokens. So, beginning in Mesopotamia around 10,000
years ago – just where and when we would expect – elites began to
craft tokens representing goods. Though we don’t know exactly how
they were used, it seems that princes and priests employed them to
track the receipts of taxes and offerings, for they are often found in
the remains of palaces and temples. They were evidently marks of high
67

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

status, for sometimes they are found in rich graves. The tokens fall into
more than a dozen categories depending on their basic geometric shape
(cones, spheres, disks, cylinders, etc.), and into additional subcategories
depending on their markings (incisions of various kinds). In the course
of time, they came to stand for many different sorts of goods: grain, oil,
bread, cakes, animals, textiles, garments, vessels, tools, perfume, metal,
and jewelry. Thousands of tokens have been found at over 100 sites
around the Middle and Near East. The token system was remarkably
durable. It was used for some 5,000 years, until it was replaced, as we’ll
see, by writing.
The token system grew in the context of the early agricultural village. Its successor, writing, grew in the context of the early tributary
state.21 In the fourth millennium BC, settlements of unprecedented size
developed in Mesopotamia. They were trading centers, as well as centers of political and religious power. The amount of tribute an early
city like Uruk handled put additional stress on the token system of
accounting, and this led to innovation in information processing. The
invention of the ﬁrst system of pictographic writing was one of the
results. In roughly 3,700 BC, Mesopotamian accountants began to place
tokens into clay envelopes in order to create archival records of transactions. The envelopes, of course, were opaque, meaning the accountants
couldn’t learn what they contained without breaking them. That was
inconvenient. So they began to impress the tokens into the envelopes
before they hardened. If an envelope had four cones impressed on it, the
accountant knew that it had four cones in it, no breaking necessary. The
accountants eventually realized that the impressions on the envelopes
made the tokens inside of them redundant. Thus, the envelopes were
replaced by clay tablets with token impressions on them. The next step
was to do away with the tokens themselves. It was discovered that one
could make a pretty decent outline of any token with a stylus. You
didn’t need a set of tokens to record transactions, you just needed the
stylus and some knowledge of what the tokens stood for. By 3,100 BC,
the drawings of tokens on tablets had become stylized and regularized,
and the writing system known as cuneiform was born.
An additional and important step was the invention – or discovery –
of abstract numbers. The token system rested on a one-to-one correspondence between goods and tokens: to represent 10 measures of grain,
you needed 10 tokens. The impressed tablet system rested on the same
68

HOMO SCRIPTOR

principle: 10 measures of grain were represented by 10 impressions. This
was manifestly inefﬁcient in terms of both space and computation, particularly when dealing with large numbers of goods such as those ﬂowing through major Mesopotamian cities. Thus, some forward-thinking
scribes invented symbols for sets of impressions. A sign like “X” was
made to stand for 10 items, and “Y” was made to stand for 20, and
“Z” for 30. To record that 10 measures of grain had been delivered to
the temple, all the scribe needed to write was “X” next to the stylized
sign for grain.
These were true numbers, and they made difﬁcult accounting problems much easier. They also represented a revolution in communications. For the ﬁrst time it was recognized that any symbol could be
made to stand for any thing or idea. The symbol didn’t need to look
like the thing it represented – that is, have an iconic or pictographic
quality – in order to be read, something that was quite impossible in
the case of abstract concepts like numbers in any case. Rather, the only
information needed to read the symbol was that it conventionally stood
for this or that. Naturally, the pictographic principle remained useful
and was still used: all of the early writing systems – cuneiform, hieroglyphics, and Chinese characters – are built on it. They began as picture
writing. But once it was realized that the symbol and the idea or thing it
signiﬁed need not be pictorially linked, a whole new universe of graphic
representation emerged. You could simply make up new symbols and
assign them meanings by associating them with ideas or things. Any
idea or thing could be “written” using this technique.
Among the things that could be written in this way were spoken
words. The idea that writing could be used to represent words was
novel to the accountants of Uruk. They lived in a world in which writing consisted of pictures of things and, perhaps, ideas like “10.” But
once they discovered that writing could be used to record speech, they
developed logographic scripts, either by associating existing pictographs
with spoken words or by inventing new symbols for words. For the ﬁrst
time, it was possible to record exactly what a person said and to write
things that were never said as if they had been. Once written, anyone
who knew the table of symbol-to-word equivalencies – what we call a
dictionary – could decode them simply by “playing them back,” that is,
reading them. Of course, the table of equivalencies was difﬁcult to learn.
A rich logographic script has tens of thousands of arbitrary symbols,
69

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

each of which must be memorized. This is not, however, impossible –
indeed, it is done by millions of Chinese school children every year,
albeit with the help of a kind of phonetic crib sheet (Pinyin).22
But there is a different writing technique that makes it possible to
recognize what word a particular symbol stands for with much less
effort, or at least memorization. Instead of using a unique symbol to
represent each word, you could use a unique symbol to represent each
of the sounds that make up all words. Speech is a combinatorial system – it uses combinations of a small number of elements to create
an inﬁnite number of expressions. Just so, every language uses a small
number of sounds – phonemes – to create a potentially inﬁnite number
of words. If you assign a symbol to each sound, you can combine the
symbols to make up any word that can be spoken. That’s a phonetic
script, and to use it to record and “play back” texts, all you need to
do is learn the small number of symbols for the phonemes in a given
language. Scribes throughout the Levant realized the economy of this
system of representing speech, and they adapted cuneiform and hieroglyphs accordingly. These writing systems, however, never became fully
phonetic scripts, not due to any deﬁciency on the part of the cultures
involved, but simply because reasonably complete phonetic scripts –
syllabaries and alphabets –apparently were not needed. The progenitor
of all modern alphabetic scripts seems to have originated in Egypt in
the early second millennium BC.23 For the next thousand years, however, the alphabet was little used.24 Eventually it gained favor among
the Phoenicians, who then spread it around the Mediterranean basin,
where it was adapted to local languages. One of them was Greek, as we
can see from Plato’s writings.
The story we have just told, that of the gradual domestication of food
sources, the organization of villages and cities, the rise of princes and
priests, and invention of writing systems to serve them, was not unique
to the Near East. It happened throughout much of the world in a relatively short period of time. It took humans six million years to evolve,
40,000 years to migrate all over the globe, but only a few thousand
years to make the transition from the oral hunter-gather band to the
literate “civilization.” In addition to the Near East, this shift occurred
independently in what is now Egypt, Pakistan, China, Peru, and Mexico, and probably not only there. In all of these places we see the
emergence of agriculture, new forms of cooperative life (villages, cities,
70

HOMO SCRIPTOR

states, temples), followed by the development of counting devices, numbers, pictographic scripts, and sometimes phonetic scripts.25 In light of
this remarkable example of social evolutionary convergence, it hardly
seems amiss to formulate a kind of law of human social evolution: if
people turn to agriculture, they will often come to be ruled by princes
and priests; and if they are ruled by princes and priests, they will often
develop writing of one sort or another. Domestication, sedentization,
princes, priests, and writing seem to go together. Indeed, they went
together so well that they formed the basis for a way of life that
dominated most of the world for nearly 5,000 years – “Manuscript
Culture.”
Writing and Human Nature

Humans took a very long time to develop writing, some 175,000 years.
This is because, we argued, the historical conditions that “pulled” writing into existence were absent before the rise of princes and priests.
Once writing was invented, however, it didn’t spread very quickly or
very far. Literacy was rare in all major Manuscript Cultures during the
entire 5,000 years of their existence. There was nothing approaching
mass literacy before for the nineteenth century, that is, well into the
Print Era. The failure of literacy to saturate Manuscript-Era populations may have had something to do with the fact that princes and
priests attempted to monopolize reading and writing. So far as we
know, Manuscript-Era elites never promoted the teaching of literacy to
the hoi polloi. On the contrary, they generally thought that widespread
literacy might be quite dangerous. The minimal penetration of literacy
in Manuscript Cultures might also be explained by the fact that reading
and writing were basically useless for most purposes. Neither the peasant, nor craftsman, nor merchant needed to be able to read or write to
do their business.
Yet there must be something more going on here. For the people
of Manuscript Cultures not only didn’t generally read or write, they
seem to have purposefully avoided reading and writing. If humans ﬁnd
pleasure in something and it can be gained at a reasonable price, they
generally do it. As we will point out shortly, it is probably the case that
literacy training, not to mention the equipment necessary to read and
write, were quite expensive in almost all Manuscript Cultures. The elites
71

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

made them more expensive by intentionally limiting supply. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that we never ﬁnd a single case of mass literacy in
any Manuscript Culture. Surely there were times and places in which
the cost of literacy declined to the point that it was available to the
person of moderate means. There are candidates: ancient Greece, early
modern China, and medieval Western Europe. In all of these places, literacy training and literature (broadly construed) were reasonably widely
available. Yet even here literacy rates – insofar as they can be guessed –
were always very low by modern standards. Why?
The answer is plain: humans, by their nature, don’t like to read or
write. Natural selection gave us nothing, physiologically speaking, to
prepare us for literacy. We were evolved to talk, which is why we have
talking organs that make talking easy. We were not evolved to read or
write, which is why we don’t have reading or writing organs and why
reading and writing are hard. In order to become literate we have to
adapt organs – our eyes, minds, hands – that were obviously evolved
for other purposes. This hijacking and rewiring process takes years
to accomplish, is quite exacting, and is never really complete.26 Even
good writers and readers get tired eyes, headaches, and hand cramps.
Moreover, evolution endowed us with a drive to talk, a drive that
makes talking quite enjoyable. Evolution did not endow us with a drive
to read and write, which is why most people throughout history have
found both tiresome.
Surely, we tell ourselves, if the Manuscript-Era masses had really had
the opportunity to become literate, they would have learned to read and
write; and if they had had something really interesting or edifying to
read, they would have read it. Of course, we can’t know if these propositions are true or not, as they rest on counterfactuals – Manuscript-Era
states did not have mass literacy programs, and Manuscript-Era writers, though they probably produced some interesting reading material,
didn’t produce very much of it. But given what we know about the way
literacy spread in modern times – namely, through compulsory education – and what we know about modern reading habits – namely, that
literate people generally don’t read very much at all – there is no good
reason to think that either statement is correct.
The needs of princes and priests “pulled” reading and writing into
existence, but they could never “pull” it very far because, as it happens,
humans don’t like to read or write.
72

HOMO SCRIPTOR

what manuscripts did
In the Manuscript Era, what was an all-talking media environment
became one characterized by talking and manuscript-writing. Before
considering the impact of manuscript-writing generally, we need to
make clear that writing did not in any sense replace talking. Rather,
it supplemented talking. Neither should we think that writing came to
dominate talking as the basic mode of human communication. That
is simply false. As we’ve seen, only a small minority of people in the
Manuscript Era could read or write; therefore, it must have been the
case that most – indeed the vast majority – of all human expression,
used for whatever purpose, remained oral. Indeed, the ways in which
orality survived and affected writing is one of the primary concerns of
Classicists and medieval historians.
By the lights of our “push” theory of media effects, manuscriptwriting should have had a signiﬁcant effect on social practices and
values in these cultures; it should have laid the foundation of a distinct
Manuscript Culture in a distinct Manuscript Era (3500 BC to AD 1450).
As we noted earlier, there is sufﬁcient primary and secondary evidence
available to assess the theory, and we will do so presently.
Accessibility

Talking and listening are cheap. Writing and reading, however, are
typically expensive. It doesn’t seem that way to most of us. We went
to school. They taught us to write and read. It wasn’t pleasant, but it
didn’t cost anything, right? Of course it did. There is no free lunch,
nor is there free literacy instruction. Ask anyone who’s paying for their
young son’s or daughter’s fancy private school. What does it cost to
gain the power of writing? First, if you are going to write and read,
you need the equipment: pen, paper, and a primer. Most people can
afford these things today; in times past they couldn’t. Once you’ve got
the tools, you need to learn to encode and decode. That’s not easy.
It takes healthy children several years of instruction to gain moderate
writing and reading proﬁciency in their native language. For reasons
we don’t quite understand, a signiﬁcant minority of children will never
learn to write and read well in their mother or any other tongue.27
Once you’ve got the tools and skill, you need to use them. That’s not
73

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

exactly easy either. A competent manuscript writer can only produce
something on the order of twenty-ﬁve words per minute, and she won’t
be able to keep up that pace for long.28 In practice, and particularly on
long projects, the rate is therefore much slower. It took Tolstoy seven
years (1862–1869) to ﬁnish a version of War and Peace – coming in at
460,000 Russian and French words – he was happy with. That’s 1.25
words a minute, assuming he worked night and day with no holidays.
A competent reader can comfortably read with comprehension roughly
250 words per minute, depending on the legibility of the hand.29 At that
pace you could theoretically decode a manuscript of War and Peace in
about thirty-one hours, though you might just die of exhaustion like the
over-reaching peasant in Tolstoy’s great story “How Much Land Does
a Man Need?”30 Incidentally, a recent book-on-tape version of War
and Peace runs a languid seventy hours.31 For whatever reason, both
writing and reading have always seemed slow to us, which is why we
have been inventing and using speed-writing and speed-reading techniques for ages. These are basically codes for codes, and none is very
effective. Woody Allen famously quipped that he took a speed-reading
course and then read War and Peace in twenty minutes. “It’s about Russia,” he reported.32 Writing and reading, then, are naturally expensive.
Interestingly, it’s not terribly difﬁcult to make them artiﬁcially more
expensive. This can be done in two ways. First, you can restrict access
to the equipment necessary – writing implements, media, and texts. In
a modern environment, this is difﬁcult because these items are so abundant and inexpensive. But in the Manuscript Era they were scarce and
costly, so it was entirely possible keep these things out of the hands of
would-be writers and readers. Second, you can segregate those who are
literate and forbid them to teach writing or to write things you might
not like. Again, this would be difﬁcult today because so many people
can read and write. But in the Manuscript Era and even after, it was a
viable and often-used strategy. Queen Elizabeth I ordered a man’s right
hand cut off for writing something she didn’t like.33 Dismemberment
doubtless made an impact on the man (whose name, ironically enough,
was John Stubbs), but he still had his left hand to write with and two
good eyes to read with. Much later, the rulers of the Soviet Union
tried to prevent their subjects from writing and reading manuscripts,
and enjoyed some success in this effort.34 Nonetheless, underground

74

HOMO SCRIPTOR

literature (samizdat) ﬂourished, and some of it was even quite
good.35
The fact that literacy is expensive and can be made more expensive
easily meant – and to some degree still means – that it is not a terribly
accessible medium, particularly compared to speech. Nearly everyone
has the equipment and skill to speak and listen, but only some people
have the equipment and skill necessary to write and read. Because literacy is not accessible, the networks it engenders will be concentrated.
Only a portion of those in a community will be literate and fully on the
network; the rest will not. By the lights of our theory, concentrated networks should hierarchicalize social practices developed in and around
them. Here, “hierarchicalize” means to engender informal and formal
ranks. The reason is this: where assets are scarce and ﬁxed, humans will
attempt to monopolize them; if successful, they will use their unequal
control over assets as a basis for unequal power, that is, to form ranks.
Both concentrated networks and hierarchicalized social practices
evolved in the Manuscript Era. As we’ve seen, hunter-gatherers generally held assets in common, including the means of communication,
speech. As humans settled down, new types of assets appeared. From
our point of view, the most signiﬁcant were tax-payers and sacred
places. In the course of time, elites monopolized these assets and then
used their unequal control as a basis for unequal power. Hierarchically
administered social practices appeared, the most important being the
palace and the temple. As the palace and temple grew more complex,
they became more reliant on writing and reading for a whole host of
reasons. Therefore, literacy itself became an asset. As demand for scribal
services rose, supply lagged due to the aforementioned cost of equipping
and training scribes. Therefore literacy became scarce. And as scribes set
up shop where writing and reading were in highest demand, in urban
areas, they became identiﬁed with and attached to places. Therefore
literacy became geographically ﬁxed. Because it was valuable, scarce,
and ﬁxed, literacy became a prime target for monopolization by those
who beneﬁted most from it. It’s no wonder, then, that throughout the
Manuscript Era, princes and priests sought to control writing and reading. Restricting access to literacy was not difﬁcult because commoners
weren’t exactly clamoring for it – literacy was of no value whatsoever
to the vast majority of Manuscript-Era people. Nonetheless, princes

75

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

and priests put up barriers just in case. They were of several types.
Since writing and reading rely on equipment, the elite tried to gain control of the requisite raw materials and the craftsmen who turned them
into the instruments of literacy – hence monopolies on media (papyrus,
silk, paper) production and copying. Since writing and reading must be
taught, they attempted to gain control of those who could teach them,
that is, the scribes themselves – hence the closed scribal caste. Since
writing was a physical artifact, they attempted to limit those who could
rightfully possess it or what could be written and read. Hence censorship. Once they added a bloody-minded penal code – the kind Queen
Elizabeth I favored – the monopolists could be reasonably sure of their
hold and the system of privilege that was built on it.
Princes and priests monopolized writing and thereby became more
princely and priestly. That was the “is” of the situation from approximately 3500 BC to several hundred years ago, when literacy became a
mass phenomenon. The “ought” developed to justify this state of affairs
was elitism, or, more speciﬁcally, the belief that the world was the way it
was – ruled by princes and priests who controlled writing – because that
was the way the heavens intended it. This notion of divinely sponsored
rule – or even divine rule itself – is enshrined in nearly every major political and religious doctrine that comes down to us from the 4,000-year
period in which Manuscript Cultures dominated the earth.36 In the third
millennium BC, Sargon of Akkad claimed divine sanction; in the second
millennium AD, King James I of England did the same. James went further, telling his subjects: “The State of Monarchie is the Supremest thing
on earth: For Kings are not onely Gods Lieutenants upon earth, and sit
upon Gods throne, but even by God himselfe they are called Gods.”37
Between Sargon and James, priestly princes and princely priests were
standard equipment in almost all Manuscript Cultures. Nearly every
Western religious tradition upholds the notion of divinely appointed
kings. In the Jewish tradition, rulers are chosen by Yahweh: “And he
changeth the times and the seasons: He removeth kings, and setteth up
kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that
know understanding” (Daniel 2: 21). In the Christian tradition, rulers
are appointed by the Lord: “For there is no power but of God. The
powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the
power, resisteth the ordinance of God” (Romans 13: 1–6). And in the
Muslim tradition, rulers are appointed by Allah: “Allah has chosen him
76

HOMO SCRIPTOR

[Talut] above you and has gifted him abundantly with knowledge and
bodily prowess; Allah grants His authority to whom He pleases” (Surah
2: 247). Note that all these doctrines were (and are) written.
Privacy

As we said earlier, talking and listening to someone usually “gives away
your position,” that is, who you are and what you’ve communicated
or heard. Writing and reading don’t, at least not to the same degree. If
you want, you can write a message to someone and be reasonably sure
that she won’t know it was you who wrote it. Naturally, you’ll have
to disguise your handwriting or typeface, alter your typical style or
subject, and have a blind proxy deliver the note, but those aren’t really
hard things to do. Ted Kaczynski, the notorious Unabomber, took the
ﬁrst and third of these precautions but forgot to take the second. David
Kaczynski recognized the “manifesto” published in the New York Times
and the Washington Post as the work of his brother, Ted, and turned
him in.38 Ted is currently serving life in prison without parole, but
you’re not a madman so you can probably pull off a simple anonymous
letter. Moreover, if, unlike the egomaniacal Unabomber, you want to
limit the circle of people who read what you write, you can do that too.
This is what “private correspondence” is supposed to signify, though
you should be aware that once you’re dead, your private correspondence
is going to be a lot less private. Secretive bureaucracies – if that’s not
redundant – love to restrict the circulation of the copious paper they
produce. For this purpose, bureaucrats have invented special stamps to
denote whether a document is on or off limits. You’ve seen them, at least
in movies: Personal and Conﬁdential, For Your Eyes Only, or the everpopular Top Secret. Perhaps the only advantage speech has over writing
in terms of privacy is that it disappears. Talking to yourself doesn’t
“give away your position” because your words vanish immediately
without leaving a trace, outside your memory, of course. Writing to
yourself, however, might “give away your position” because it leaves a
relatively permanent record of what you wrote. That’s why people who
work in criminal organizations, tyrannical governments, and the White
House are strongly advised not to keep “private” notes. Rule number
one: never write anything down. As for reading, it’s generally easy to
privatize: just get an anonymous post ofﬁce box, an opaque bag, and
77

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

close your door. When you are done, you might want to dispose of
your reading material in a dumpster behind the mall. The FBI will look
through your personal trash bins.
Writing and reading, then, can be made quite private. If you are careful, you can use writing to communicate anonymously to a restricted
circle of correspondents. If you are careful, you can similarly ensure
that what you read will not become known to anyone. When writing
and reading are used privately, they create segmented networks, that is,
networks that have restricted places in them. Information ﬂows within
the segment but cannot easily ﬂow between segments. Our theory has
it that segmented networks close social practices realized in and around
them. Here “close” means tending to anonymize and remove from public view. The reason is this: if humans can beneﬁt from concealing their
identities or activities, they will often do so; segmented networks allow
them to do this. Writing permits you to hide, and hiding can work to
your advantage.
Both segmented networks and closed social practices evolved during
the rise of reading and writing in the Manuscript Era. In the huntergatherer band, nothing could really be hidden because everyone could
speak and hear. In Manuscript Culture, however, the princes’ and
priests’ unequal hold on writing made hiding relatively straightforward.
The elite could read and write; commoners couldn’t. That gave the elite
its own “private channel.” The princes used it to privatize what had
been public authority. Thus, the law became their law, though they
continued to say that it was validated by tradition or divine sanction.
The priests used it to privatize sacred power. Among hunter-gatherers,
everyone could receive, understand, and interpret the sacred. Writing
changed each of these things. In the Hebrew Bible, God told Moses he
didn’t want just anyone coming up to Mount Sinai to receive the law.
Moses could ascend, and perhaps his brother Aaron, but the rest of
the Israelites had to remain a safe distance below (Exodus 19: 20–24).
If you were among that select group, you could talk to the Lord; if
not, then not. Most people weren’t. Upon his return from Mount Sinai,
“Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord” (Exodus 24: 4). If you
could read, then you could understand the Lord; if not, then not. Most
people couldn’t. By writing the sacred down, the priests segregated it;
by segregating it, they were able to interpose themselves as readers
between god and man. The question of interpretation remained, but it
78

HOMO SCRIPTOR

had an obvious answer: God had given the elite the ability to receive
and understand holy words; therefore it should have the sole right to
interpret them.
Princes and priests used literacy to privatize the public and the sacred.
That was the “is” of the situation from the birth of civilization and
remained so until government became “open” and church was separated
from state – both recent phenomena. The “ought” elaborated to buttress
de facto privatization was privatism, or, more speciﬁcally, the doctrine
that God had given princes and priests an exclusive dispensation to
receive, read, and interpret important texts. Such things, so it was held,
were not and should not be given to laypeople. In their hands, the elite
said, the words of the divine might be misinterpreted, and that might
jeopardize the safety of the community and the souls of the faithful.
Moses, Jesus, and Mohamed received the Word of the Lord (or, in
the case of Jesus, was the Lord). You didn’t. Their true disciples were
entrusted with that Word. You weren’t. Their rightful successors –
rabbis, priests, and imams – know what the Word means. You don’t.
So all in all it’s best to leave the Word where it is, ﬁrmly in the private
hands of princes and priests.
Fidelity

Some writers are praised for their descriptive powers. Tolstoy provides
an example. He could, so it is said, really “paint a picture.” Actually
he couldn’t. He couldn’t paint a picture because he wasn’t painting. He
was writing. With words. “Word pictures” are not pictures. You will
never see Pierre reunited with Natasha in War and Peace. All you can
do is read about it. The “mind’s eye” is not an eye. Your mind can’t see
Pierre, Natasha, or anything else Tolstoy wrote about. All it can do is
imagine. One might say that phonetic or logographic writing is a sort of
“picture” of sound, or rather a small set of sounds arranged in a certain
order. By reading a phonetically or logographically recorded sentence
out loud – say, “When she smiled, there could be no doubt. It was
Natasha, and he loved her”39 – you can reproduce the sounds someone
spoke, if someone spoke them. Ideographic scripts can’t even do that,
as they don’t represent sounds in any direct way at all. Writing, then,
isn’t iconic. The written word “daisy” neither looks like the spoken
word “daisy” – which doesn’t look like anything – or a real daisy at
79

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

all. Writing’s signs are unmotivated by the things to which they refer:
there is no necessary reason why the collections of symbols “d-a-i-s-y”
should stand for the spoken word “daisy” or a daisy itself. Like speech,
writing reduces the data of all ﬁve senses to one channel – vision – and
therefore is what we call a ﬁve-to-one code. It encodes every manner of
experience as little scribbles, even experiences that aren’t little scribbles.
In the process, lots of information is lost. Things get distorted. As Elvis
Costello put it with reference to his own art: “Writing about music is
like dancing about architecture.”40
Writing, then, is a low-ﬁdelity medium. What goes “in” is sight,
sound, smell, taste, and touch; what comes “out” is sight, and encoded
sight at that. Low-ﬁdelity media give rise to symbolic networks. Such
networks require quite a bit of effort to get on and use, and they tend
to disﬁgure sense data transmitted over them. By the lights of our theory, symbolic media networks should conceptualize social practices that
emerge within them. This means that concrete, individual entities perceived by the senses in the here and now – say those pretty ﬂowers with
yellow petals over there – will be removed from their context and placed
under timeless conceptual categories like “daisies.” The reason is that
the symbolic network, built as it is on unmotivated signs designating
categories, itself prompts humans to begin playing with the signs and
building useful, shared representational systems out of them.
Literacy made symbolic networks more symbolic and conceptualized social practices more abstract in the Manuscript Era. Both speech
and writing are ﬁve-to-one codes, so both speech and writing affected
social practices in the same way, that is, by abstraction. But writing’s
impact was much greater for a simple reason: writing turns words into
things. Spoken words are invisible and evanescent: you can’t really do
anything with them other than change the order in which they appear
and immediately disappear. You “run” spoken words in one dimension
(time) and in one direction (forward). In contrast, written words are
visible and persistent: you can juxtapose them in all kinds of ways. You
“arrange” written words in multiple dimensions (vertical, horizontal,
depth) and multiple directions (up-down, right-left, back-forth). Using
these characteristics of writing, princes and priests created much more
elaborate schemata of social practices than was ever possible in the
Talking Era. Oral laws and myths could only become so long and so
complex before they surpassed the limits of memory; written laws and
80

HOMO SCRIPTOR

myths could expand almost inﬁnitely and reach remarkable levels of
complexity. With the intrusion of writing into the practice of modeling social practices, what was invisible became visible, what was simple
became complex, and what was concrete became abstract. This not only
changed the nature of once-oral social practices, but it also stabilized
them. Within the hunter-gatherer band, social practices were ghostly
and therefore always being renegotiated; within early Manuscript Culture, social practices were visible – you could read them – and therefore
less subject to change. Naturally, people altered even written social
practices, but writing’s capacity to make words into things reduced the
rate of change. Of course, this “slowing down” served the interests of
those who beneﬁted from the status quo, that is, princes and priests.
Princes and priests used writing to conceptualize social practices in
law codes and sacred myths. That was the “is” of the situation and
remained so until writing slipped out of the hands of the elite in the early
modern period. The “ought” evolved to support written abstraction was
idealism, or, more speciﬁcally, the doctrine that writing was a divine gift
that linked humans to the all-important unseen world. The Sumerians
believed that writing was brought from heaven by the deity Enki.41 The
Babylonians credited the discovery of writing to a descendant of Enki
named Nabu. The Egyptians considered the goddess Seshat the inventor
of writing. They said, however, it was Thoth, the deity of writing, who
taught writing to men. Plato, incidentally, repeats the myth of Thoth
(Phaedrus, 274C–275B),42 whom most of the Greeks called “Hermes.”
The Romans, who cribbed most everything from the Hellenes, took
Hermes and transformed him into Mercury, one of whose titles was
“inventor of writing.” Writing, then, was brought from the unseen
world. As such, it could be used to gain access to the unseen world. It
didn’t matter whether the unseen world was populated by perfect forms
(Plato) or a wrathful god (Moses). In either case it was better there than
it was here. Since words were the bridge between there and here, they
were not ordinary things – they were sacred. And as such they required
“special handling” and became bogged down with a great variety of
“dos and don’ts.” We see this in Plato, who rails against the rhetoricians
who misuse language and understand nothing of the Truth. And we see
it in the Hebrew Bible, in which God issues all kinds of rules regarding
the treatment of the Arc of the Covenant (Exodus 25: 10–22; Exodus
40: 3; Leviticus 16) and, later, the Torah.43

Volume

War and Peace is long, but – at 460,000 words – it’s hardly the longest
novel ever written. There are several contenders for this title. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Marcel Proust’s autobiographical Remembrance of Things Past (1913–27) takes the prize at
1.5 million words.44 But according to Wikipedia (which, incidentally, is
the world’s longest encyclopedia),45 Sohachi Yamaoka’s historical epic
Tokugawa Ieyasu (1950–67) and Mark Leach’s science-ﬁction thriller
Marienbad My Love (2008), each of which runs 10 million words,
beat Proust hands down.46 A graphomaniac named Richard Grossman
has set out to end the controversy once and for all. When completed,
he claims his experimental novel Breeze Avenue will run three million
pages and comprise roughly one billion words. There are plans for a
book tour.47 But here’s the most amazing part: somebody with a lot
of time on her hands might even read Breeze Avenue. If you read 250
words a minute (a comfortable pace),48 eight hours a day (you need
your beauty rest), 240 days a year (weekends or holidays off), you’d be
done in thirty-ﬁve years. If you read faster and stretched it out, it would
be doable, though not really advisable. The point is this: a billion words
probably approaches the upper bound of the length of a written message
decodable by one person in one lifetime. Logically, we might guess that
the lower bound is one word. In the case of a novel (or any story, for
that matter), the practical lower bound is a bit higher. The shortest story
Hemingway could write – and Hemingway was a big fan of brevity –
consisted of six words, three periods, and ﬁve spaces: “For Sale. Baby
Shoes. Never Worn.”49 So we have Breeze Avenue at one extreme and
“For Sale” at the other. The rest fall in the middle, and the vast majority
of them toward the “For Sale” end. As we noted in the last chapter, the
capacity of a medium to carry information is determined not only by the
typical length of messages, but also by the number of people who receive
them. How many people can read your manuscript simultaneously?
Well, that obviously depends on how many times you’ve copied it and
how many people you’ve given it to who will actually read it. The answer
is probably “Not very many” on both counts, because manuscripts are
hard to reproduce and transmit. Copying is a pain. Your hand gets
sore. Your eyes get tired. It’s not for nothing that teachers use writing as a punishment (“Write ‘I will not talk in class’ 100 times on
82

HOMO SCRIPTOR

the chalkboard”). Carrying texts from person to person is not easy
either. We pay postal ofﬁcials to do this onerous task. And not all the
folks who receive your text will read it. Reading is not the most exciting
thing a person can do, which is why many people use it as a soporiﬁc.
It’s no wonder, then, that writing is a low-volume medium: its messages are typically short and difﬁcult to reproduce and distribute. Lowvolume media give rise to constrained networks, that is, networks over
which the number and size of packets of information moving between
nodes is quite limited. Just how many and how large these packets
are depends on the cost of production, reproduction, transport, and
consumption. These costs have declined radically over the past several
hundred years. In the Manuscript Era, however, making, copying, moving, and reading text were expensive. Therefore, the packets were few
and small, and thus the resulting networks were constrained. According
to our theory, constrained networks economize social practices developed in and around them. In these networks, people will consciously
limit their use of scarce resources – bandwidth, to use a modern analogy – to essential activities because the network itself does not have the
excess capacity to allow for playful use.
Literacy made already constrained networks more constrained and
already economized social practices more economical in the Manuscript
Era. Both speech and writing are low-volume media, so both had the
same kind of impact on social practices, namely, economization. But
writing and reading pushed things much further in this direction for one
reason: they are, compared to speech, really quite hard to learn and do.
The hand was not built for writing. The eye was not designed for reading. In order to write and read, humans have to adapt capacities that
were evolved to do other work. That process is difﬁcult, and we successfully avoided it for some 175,000 years. Then we invented writing.
We didn’t invent it for pleasure – far from it. We invented it because it
was a tool we needed to do other things. “Tool” is just the right word,
because for the ﬁrst several thousand years of its existence, writing
was used almost exclusively to do important, necessary work – keeping accounts, writing laws, copying scripture. An early Mesopotamian
prince or priest would no more spend the expensive bandwidth afforded
by writing for frivolous entertainment than he would make a gilded piss
pot. Naturally, some ancients did use writing for non-utilitarian purposes, just as some probably urinated in golden pots. But the people
83

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

who did so were most often the wealthy and powerful, and they often
did these silly things simply to show they were wealthy and powerful.
As we would say, they had “money to burn” and burned it to show
they did. Most people, however, didn’t, and therefore we ﬁnd them
using writing sparingly and only when it was really needed. A lot of
texts survive from the ﬁrst two millennia of writing, but only a handful
are in any sense entertaining or, as we would say, “literary.” About
the year 1000 BC, literary activity seems to pick up. The “rich” GrecoLatin, Sanskrit, and Chinese literary traditions are born, traditions that
continue to exist to this day. But we should not exaggerate their “richness”: in the Manuscript Era, only elites read for pleasure, and very few
of them at that. For most people, writing was just too precious to waste
on fun. So they didn’t.
Literacy in the Manuscript Era was a scarce resource and had to
be used carefully. That was the “is” of the situation and remained so
until mass literacy emerged in the late Print Era. The “ought” elaborated to support the judicious use of writing is asceticism, and more
speciﬁcally the doctrine that some texts were quite harmful. It was
one thing to study approved secular and sacred texts, what the Greeks
called paideia. This was encouraged as it resulted in ediﬁcation. But it
was quite another to spend your time using the lingua sacra to amuse
yourself and others. That was not encouraged as it resulted in corruption. When we think of censorship, our minds usually wander to the
Papacy’s Index Librorum Prohibitorum or the Nazis and their infamous book bonﬁres. But censorship was common and commonsense in
the Manuscript Era.50 Plato’s teacher and hero, Socrates, was killed for
what he believed and said. Yet Plato himself was a big supporter of censorship (The Republic, 382b).51 The Romans, though they wrote some
literature and seemed to have enjoyed it, institutionalized censorship.52
Throughout the Manuscript Era, people agreed that writing certain
kinds of things was immoral and reading them dangerous, therefore
they should not be written or read. This opinion has lasted well into
our own age.
Velocity

A famous quip often attributed to Pascal goes, “I’m sorry to have written
you this long letter, but I didn’t have time to make it short.”53 Short or
84

HOMO SCRIPTOR

long, writing – and reading – take time. As we already noted, a typical
writer can jot down 25 words per minute, and a typical reader can
digest roughly 250 words in the same time. Speed-writing and speedreading can increase each of these rates by a small multiple, but only
with a considerable loss of clarity and comprehension respectively. This,
however, is not the worst of it. Ordinarily, when people say “the check
is in the mail,” they mean that it isn’t. But it might be, because the
mail is slow and everyone knows it. Unfortunately, words written on
hard media (stone, clay, bark, reeds, fabric, paper) must be schlepped
from place to place. Thus, their velocity is a function of the speed of
the vehicle that carries them. In the Manuscript Era, that wasn’t very
fast. A ﬁt adult with a light load can easily walk something on the order
of 15 miles a day in good conditions, though he or she will be tired,
hungry, and have blisters at the end of it. Running is faster, but not as
efﬁcient (see “The Tortoise and the Hare” for more). A horse with a
light load can walk on the order of 30 miles a day in good conditions,
but needs to eat along the way, meaning you either have to carry the
fodder (which makes the load heavy and pace slower) or stick to green
pastures (which isn’t always possible). Galloping is faster, but not as
efﬁcient (see “Barbaro” for more). A well-equipped sailboat with an
experienced crew can travel roughly 150 to 200 miles a day in the
open ocean, though actual rates vary considerably (see “Doldrums” for
more). And oceans are generally quite large. Once we enter the era of
mechanically propelled craft, things pick up considerably. Trucks travel
above 60 mph, trains above 100 mph, propeller-driven transport planes
above 300 mph, and jet-powered transport planes above 600 mph. That
may seem fast, but remember that the human voice moves at 770 mph,
though admittedly over a much shorter distance. A data-bearing light
wave speeds through a ﬁber-optic cable at about 124,000 miles per
second, about two-thirds the speed of light in a vacuum. That means it
can circle the entire world in about two blinks of an eye. Of course, no
matter how you send your written words, they may never get to where
you want them. That’s inﬁnitely slow. The disappearance of written
messages is a particular problem on the surface of the earth, which
is uneven, irregular, unstable, magnetized, irradiated, pressurized, and
enveloped in a radically volatile, electrically charged mass of nitrogen,
oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and vaporized H2 O. Carrying things
around on it is tricky business. It’s no wonder that the UK’s Royal Mail
85

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

reported in 2002 that it lost 500,000 pieces of mail a week.54 “Neither
rain, nor sleet, nor gloom of night . . . ” Well, most of the time.
Writing and reading, then, are slow. You cannot produce, transmit,
or consume a text very quickly. Slow media engender monologic networks, that is, networks in which it is hard to exchange information
rapidly. Of course, you can trade information with someone by writing,
and people do all the time. But if it takes you hours to write a short
letter, the post ofﬁce days to deliver it to the recipient, more hours for
the recipient to read it and draft a reply, and more days for the post
ofﬁce to get it back to you and for you to read it, what you have is a
“correspondence,” which is how we say “slow-motion dialogue.” The
exchange is so leisurely that it may seem like nothing but a series of
staggered monologues. In our theory, monologic networks centralize
social practices realized in and around them. Here “centralize” means
tending to concentrate power in the hands of the sender rather than the
recipient of a message. The reason is this: if humans can use a media network to “speak” and make others “listen,” they often will; monologic
networks offer this opportunity.
Both centralized networks and centralized social practices grew with
the arrival of literacy in the Manuscript Era. In the world of the huntergatherers, everyone in the band could speak to everyone else more or
less simultaneously. In the world of the early Manuscript Cultures, this
was no longer possible, at least when the “speaking” was done through
writing. The elite “spoke,” and the unlettered masses “listened.” Princes
and priests of the Manuscript Era issued written pronouncements that
were then read aloud by proxies (messengers, heralds, criers). This is
not to say that there was no room for exchange between the powerful and the petty in Manuscript Cultures. There was, but it occurred
at a safe distance and was thoroughly ritualized. Just as God forbade
the Israelites to ascend Mount Sinai, so the elite prohibited the illiterate masses from entering the palace and the temple. Occasionally, the
elite would grant the hoi polloi an “audience”; however, the powerful
required the humble speakers to bow and scrape before they said anything. In addition, they strictly limited what could be said and how it
could be said. These were not “discussions.” More generally, the elite
demanded that the masses communicate their wants and needs through
a conduit it could even more efﬁciently control, that is, writing. Nearly
every Manuscript-Era polity had a formal petitionary procedure by
86

HOMO SCRIPTOR

which subjects begged “pardon and favor” from the powerful in textual
form. Here again, the petitioners were required to humiliate themselves.
In old Russian petitions, the petitioners described themselves as “lowly
slaves” who “beat their heads” at the feet of “masters.”55 Since the
petitioners were usually illiterate, they had to hire a notary to draft the
document. Once the petition was submitted, it might or might not be
answered. If it was, it wouldn’t be soon and would usually be in written
form.
Princes and priests used literacy to turn what had been dialogue into
monologue. That was the “is” of the situation and remained so well
into the Print Era. The “ought” created to legitimize top-down communications was dictatorism or, more speciﬁcally, the doctrine that
princes and priests were authorized by God to “speak” to commoners
via writing and that the latter could only under strict conditions “talk”
back. We’ve already seen that the elite of Manuscript Cultures routinely
propagated (and believed) the idea that its sovereignty, control of literacy, and the objects it wrote – especially laws and holy texts – were
gifts from beyond given to it and only it. This was as it should be. It
followed that the divinely sanctioned elite should be obeyed, that is,
that its subjects should act with the utmost humility just as it would
before God. Humility meant, among other things, not “talking” back.
The idea that some people should have the privilege of speaking and
writing their minds freely is found in Classical Antiquity, but almost
always with reference to elites.56 For everyone else, silent obedience was
the rule. It was, however, a largely unspoken rule because there was no
need to speak it – it was just obvious. The rule of silent obedience was
spoken only when it was violated or might be, which was rarely. Thus,
Paul found himself in the odd position of telling the Roman protoChristians what they should have already known, that is, to shut up
and do whatever the emperor told them (Romans 13: 1–6). Like all
princes and priests, the Roman ruler was God’s agent, so one had to act
accordingly.
Range

Homer liked to put “winged words” into the mouths of his characters.57
Achilles or someone would get all excited and “winged words” would
come ﬂying out. But as we’ve seen, “winged words” don’t ﬂy very
87

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

far, and the farther they ﬂy, the less they mean. Written words are
another matter entirely, as the texts of the Iliad and Odyssey themselves
demonstrate. Though wingless, they have ﬂown from tiny Greece to
points all over the world. It’s only a slight exaggeration to say that these
two poems are to be found wherever people are to be found. Moreover,
the trip from Greece to everywhere doesn’t seem to have done them
any harm. Generally speaking, they land in the same form they took
off, that is, with the words legible and in roughly the right order. One
place you won’t ﬁnd the Iliad and the Odyssey is outer space. But that
doesn’t mean there’s nothing to read there. When designing Voyager I in
the early 1970s, engineers were concerned that, should the deep-space
probe be encountered by extraterrestrials, it would have nothing to say.
So, in striking conﬁrmation of our thesis that humans just must be heard
even if no one is listening, they placed a golden record on board with lots
of information about the earth and its inhabitants. When Voyager I left
Cape Canaveral in 1977, the record’s label read “The Sounds of earth.
United States of America. Planet earth.”58 Today, it is roughly 10 billion
miles from the sun and probably reads the same way, not that anyone
has read it or ever will. In the right conditions – and space is so empty
that conditions are ideal – a textual message on a durable medium will
just keep going, and going, and going. Its range is practically unlimited.
Naturally, all conditions are not right and all media are not durable,
especially on our little blue sphere. Things fall apart, the center cannot
hold, and our written messages get effaced, broken, crumpled, torn,
shredded, soaked, desiccated, burned, and otherwise made illegible all
the time as they “wing” their way from here to there.
Often they make it. But that doesn’t mean that they make it to many
people. For, despite the fact that writing has excellent range, it has poor
reach. Unlike the unaided human voice, which is a broadcast medium,
writing is a point-to-point medium. There is an important difference in
the way the reach of each is ﬁgured. Recall that the reach of a broadcast medium is a function of the area its signal covers. The stronger
the signal, the more area; the more area, the more recipients. In contrast, the reach of a point-to-point medium is primarily a function of
the cost of message reproduction and delivery. On the one hand, if a
point-to-point medium allows for inexpensive copying and dispatch of
messages to many parties simultaneously, then its reach will be wide.
If, on the other hand, a point-to-point medium does not permit cheap
88

HOMO SCRIPTOR

reproduction and distribution, then its reach will be narrow. Writing clearly falls into the latter category. It’s reasonably easy to write
and carry a letter to one person. But it’s much more difﬁcult to copy
that letter many times by hand and carry it to many people. In the
Manuscript Era, only the powerful had the resources to extend the naturally limited reach of writing. Nonetheless, the fact that the elite could
use writing to “broadcast” messages marked a real improvement over
speech, for it meant that at least some messages could be distributed en
masse.
Writing is a long-range medium with moderate reach, which is to say
it can be transported over long distances with little loss of information
to a moderate number of people. Long-range media engender extensive
networks, ones in which nodes can be far apart, cover a large area,
and unite many people. By the lights of our theory, extensive networks
diversify social practices realized in and around them. Here “diversify”
means to become composed of several different parts, and particularly
ethnically different parts. The reason is this: people in extensive networks are more likely to encounter strangers than they are in intensive
networks; sustained contact with strangers will often lead to practical cooperation and, eventually, toleration. In this instance, familiarity
does not breed contempt, but rather its opposite, though usually quite
slowly.
Diversiﬁcation almost certainly occurred as writing spread during
the Manuscript Era. Hunter-gather bands were small, relatively isolated, and homogeneous. The band’s immediate successor, the agricultural village, remained small, isolated, and homogeneous. But as villages
found reason to begin stable trade relations – trade being an easy and
obvious way to increase well-being – they became linked. Surplus in
the villages and trade between them naturally attracted bandits, violent
“entrepreneurs” who ﬁgured it was easier to take than make. In an
effort to stave off predation, the villagers sometimes formed defensive
alliances. More often, the bandits themselves realized it was better to
keep the goose alive and harvest the golden eggs than to kill it. So they
made the villagers “offers they couldn’t refuse” and set up what were in
essence gloriﬁed protection rackets. Whether voluntary or forced, these
extractive networks were the ﬁrst “states.” The early states needed
a way to keep track of what had been “contributed” and to stay in
touch with those far-ﬂung ofﬁcials who collected tribute. Speech was
89

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

short-range so it wouldn’t do. Writing, however, was long-range and
worked well. What had been a trade network with a protection network
superimposed upon it became an extensive media network, often knit
together by safe roads and postal services. Moreover, these states were
sometimes not content with the territory they already controlled, and so
sought to bring “unprotected” settlements within their aegis by poaching the protected settlements of their competitors. This marked the
beginning of imperialism and further expanded the written network.
Naturally, the long process of state-building and imperial expansion
brought many strangers together for the ﬁrst time. The imperial center wanted to know who its various subjects and neighbors were, and
the subjects themselves wanted information on foreigners united in the
empire and on its outskirts. These parties began to gather information
on foreigners, write it down, and circulate it through the empire. This
was the origin of ethnography in the Manuscript Era.59 One can ﬁnd
reasonably detailed descriptions of what we would call “ethnicities”
in the writings of many ancient authors, including Herodotus, Aristotle, Strabo, Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder, Tacitus, and Sextus Empiricus,
to mention only the most famous. One might also include the Hebrew
Bible here, which includes many ethnonyms and descriptions of ethnic
groups.60
Writing expanded and thereby pluralized the world – or rather the
“world picture” – of the people who used it. That was the “is” of the
situation and it remains so in our era, as the practice of ethnography
itself attests. The “ought” developed to excuse diversiﬁcation was pluralism, or more speciﬁcally, the idea that “our world” included many
different kinds of people and things. Since these people and things were
no longer “strangers,” but rather the “them” in “us and them,” we had
a mild obligation to get to know them and, where they cooperated, be
kind to them. Of these two propositions, the former – know “them” –
is not attested in the sources, though it is implied by the very practice
of ethnography. The latter proposition – kindness to “them” – is everywhere attested in the religions of the Manuscript Era.61 For example,
God instructed the Israelites, “Thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for
ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of
Egypt” (Exodus 23: 9). Christianity and Islam are even more ecumenical, insisting not only that “we” must be kind to “them,” but that we
must convert them, in essence making “them” into “us.”

Persistence

Next time you’re in London, stop by the British Museum. Take the
stairs to the third ﬂoor and ﬁnd your way to Room 55.62 Look for a
clay slab measuring 6 inches by 5.25 inches with a lot of tiny, geometric
markings on it. The markings are writing, meaning the artifact is a
document. By most accounts, the tablet is at least 2,600 years old. And
here’s the most remarkable part: it’s legible. Twenty-six centuries after
it was inscribed, you can still read it. Unfortunately, you’ll have to
learn to decipher the dead language of Akkadian encoded in the dead
script of cuneiform to do it. But if you accomplish this feat, you’ll ﬁnd
that the text is quite readable and relates an interesting story about a
ﬂood – actually the ﬂood – from The Epic of Gilgamesh. The point is
this: written words can be astonishingly persistent. Just how persistent
they are depends largely on two things. The ﬁrst is the substance on
which they are written. Hard media like stone and ﬁred clay are very
durable. They are basically impervious to heat, light, and water. So,
unless they are crushed or effaced, they are likely to survive for a long
time. Soft media like papyrus, parchment, and paper are not as tough
because they are made of organic material, just as you are for the most
part. Heat, light, and water will destroy all of them in short order.
Since it’s hard to keep things cool, shaded, and dry on the surface of
the earth, which is often warm, sunny, and wet, we possess only a few
texts on soft media older than a millennium.63 Whether hard or soft,
all media of whatever sort will return to dust, just as we will. Happily,
the life of the words they bear can be extended by copying them on
a new substrate made of whatever you fancy. Naturally, copying may
introduce errors, and texts that have been copied many times are full
of them. But the upside of copying outweighs the downside. Think
about this: were it not for the practice of serial copying, we would
know next to nothing about the literature of the Manuscript Era. For
example, we have no “ﬁrst edition” of the Iliad. In truth, we have no
contemporaneous edition of the Iliad at all. Rather, we possess a tenthcentury copy, which itself is a copy of a copy of a copy . . . and so on
all the way back to Plato’s day.64 Good thing copyright is a modern
invention. The second factor that determines the persistence of a text
is the stability of the language and script in which it is written. We all
realize that computer languages and codes come and go. You probably
91

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

have computer ﬁles that can’t be “read” by the computer you are using
now. Functionally, your ﬁles are “dead.” Human languages and scripts
come and go too, often independently of one another.65 Languages can
die and their scripts live on (e.g., Latin and Latin characters), and scripts
can die and their languages live on (e.g., Runes and German). If you
know a language but not the script it’s written in, then you have an
encrypted code. If you know a script but not the language encoded in it,
then (assuming the script is phonetic) you can vocalize a language you
can’t understand. In either case, the writing itself conveys no meaning,
and writing that conveys no meaning is dead.
Writing, then, is persistent, or at least can be made persistent. If
you record something on a reasonably durable medium, you can rest
assured that it will be around for a while, and maybe even a long while
indeed. Persistent media give rise to additive networks, that is, ones in
which data accumulate. In additive networks, nodes in the present are
in a kind of dialogue with nodes in the past. A reader on an additive
network can pick up a document from, say, 2,600 years ago, and, if
it is legible, read someone’s words from 2,600 years ago. If you make
some very reasonable assumptions (that there is a past, it’s continuous
with our present, and the relationship is temporally linear), then the
reader in question has established a link across time and therefore across
an additive network. There are some curious things about additive
networks, the most important of which is that information can only
ﬂow in one direction over them, namely, from past to present. Outside
science ﬁction, it’s always now. You can’t travel to the past and say
anything in it. But the past can travel to you and does indeed speak
after a fashion. There are lots of mind-bending philosophical puzzles
to be worked out here, but all we need note is that additive media
networks generally historicize social practices realized in and around
them. Here “historicize” means to lengthen people’s time horizons to
such an extent that the past, present, and future become distinct. The
reason is this: people in additive media networks are more likely to
encounter meaningful, recognizable, datable artifacts from the past than
people living in a substitutive network. This means that they have a
more detailed understanding of the past than people in a substitutive
network.
We can clearly see the impact of additive networks in early
Manuscript Cultures. To hunter-gatherers living in an oral environment,
92

HOMO SCRIPTOR

data about the past – and especially the human past – were available to
the present primarily as subjective memories, spoken words, and rituals.
This meant two things. First, the messages “sent” from the past to the
present would be few and unclear. Memory and ritual can only store a
limited amount of information, and speech none at all. What they do
store is usually compressed as gists, resulting in the loss of information.
Naturally these gists decay, resulting in the loss of more information.
For these reasons information in an oral environment does not accumulate easily. Second, the messages “sent” from the past to the present are
not easy to move around. Subjective memories cannot be easily manipulated because of the limits of short-term memory. Even if you know
calculus, you can’t do it in your head. Spoken words cannot be moved
around easily because they disappear. Speaking is a means of transmitting information, not recording it. Rituals cannot be easily manipulated
because they are not consciously held in memory, but rather performed.
They provide no signs to move around. Writing changed this situation
dramatically. Since writing is persistent, it can store a lot of information
for a long time. The more information stored, the more of the past is
made available to the present. Human history appears with writing,
as we can see in the case of the famous “Lists of Kings,” compiled
by Sumerians, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.66 The Hebrew
Bible’s “Book of Kings” is of a piece with these proto-histories as it
essentially tells the stories of the rulers of Israel and Judah.67 By the
time we get to Herodotus, we have history as we would understand
it: the empirical study of events that occurred at a speciﬁc place and
speciﬁc (past) time.68
Writing not only provided the stuff out of which history could be
constructed, it also offered a medium in which persistent symbols could
be moved around. With writing, you can arrange signs liberally in twodimensional space, hold them in place indeﬁnitely, play them back, and
then rearrange them. That means you can construct a vast range of
symbolic “pictures,” store them, reread them, and then touch them up.
This activity is important for science. Let’s be clear: humans have always
thought scientiﬁcally and used language to do it. Writing simply provided them with a much better tool. And once they had it, they used it, as
we can see in the explosion of scientiﬁc activity in the Manuscript Era.69
Aristotle alone used writing to explore politics, ethics, logic, poetics,
rhetoric, physics, astronomy, metaphysics, biology, and psychology. It
93

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

wasn’t as if people hadn’t thought about these things before, or thought
about them scientiﬁcally. They had. It’s just that Aristotle had the right
tool for the job, or at least a superior one.
In the Manuscript Era, people – though primarily princes and
priests – exploited the persistence of writing to create persistent pictures of the past and the world. That was the “is” of the matter and
remains so today. The “ought” evolved to support picture-making was
temporalism, or, more speciﬁcally, the idea that the past, present, and
future form a continuous, measurable, observable strip. In this world,
you were no longer standing still on a still point. Rather, you were
walking along a strip. As you do, things change in the “present,” disappear in the “past,” and appear in the “future.” Your time horizon may
be short – a dynasty – or it may be long – the life of the universe – but
the essential rule of “travel” is the same: you must move forward at a
constant pace. You can’t go back, you can’t stand still, and you can’t
slow down or speed up. Given this view of time, and the existence of
a lot of evidence – written and natural – you might well want to know
how you got to where you are and where you were going to go. People
of the Manuscript Era did. Thus, they began to use writing to analyze
the past with an eye to the future, or what we call “history.” Listen to
Cicero: “History is the witness of the times, the light of truth, the life of
memory, the teacher of life, the messenger of antiquity.”70 Though he
was more enthusiastic than most, the writing of history was clearly seen
as a virtue in the Manuscript Era.71 And people of the Manuscript Era
began using writing to rationally analyze the present with an eye to the
future, that is, to practice what we generically call “science.” According
to Aristotle, when someone asked Anaxagoras what the purpose of life
was, he replied, “For the sake of contemplating the heavens and the
whole order of the universe.”72 Aristotle did not necessarily agree, but
he, together with countless others in the Manuscript Era, surely viewed
the study of nature to be a virtue.
Searchability

The clay tablet now found in Room 55 of the British Museum was,
not surprisingly, looted by a band of British antiquity hunters.73 The
group, lead by Austin Henry Layard, found the tablet circa 1850 in a
tell near the modern-day city of Mosel in the modern-day country of
94

HOMO SCRIPTOR

Iraq. They shipped it back to England because they thought it might be
valuable. They could only guess, however, because they couldn’t read
it. The script and language of the tablet – cuneiform and Akkadian –
were not fully deciphered at mid-century. Moreover, even if they could
have read it, they probably couldn’t have found it among the mass of
tablets they were busily digging up and shipping off. Layard didn’t just
uncover a single tablet, he unearthed a whole library, that constructed
by one King Ashurbanipal in the seventh century BC. Ashurbanipal
apparently liked to collect texts, for his library had a lot of them. Thanks
to the industrious if larcenous efforts of Layard and his successors, the
British Museum holds more than 30,000 tablets from it. And that’s
only what has survived and been uncovered. With this in mind, it’s easy
to understand how the tablet of The Epic of Gilgamesh might just go
missing, both in Ashurbanipal’s day and in Layard’s, for it was hidden
in an ocean of other tablets. Perhaps Ashurbanipal’s bibliographers
compiled a kind of card catalogue that told readers where every tablet
was in the library. If they did, Layard didn’t ﬁnd it, so all he could do
was hunt and peck. As we’ve said, a misshelved book is a lost book. A
tablet unearthed from a tell among thousands of others like it is pretty
much lost as well, “lost” in the sense of “very difﬁcult to ﬁnd.”
This is because written text in and of itself is hard to search through
for a whole host of reasons. First, you have to have access to it to search
it, and sometimes you don’t. If you can’t get to the tell, then your search
for cuneiform gold is over before it starts. Second, texts usually have
to be searched serially, meaning you look at items one after another
until you ﬁnd the thing you want. There are ways around this. Books
have indexes and libraries have catalogues. These are some help, but
tend not to be ﬁne-grained – the index doesn’t go very deep, and the
catalogue doesn’t get you “inside the book.” Third, searching text is
slow, at least with the equipment most of us have on-board. If our eyes
and brains scanned text at a high velocity, then it wouldn’t matter that
we have to search text serially. We’d just ﬁre through it like a computer
ﬁres through electronic text. But in fact our eyes and brains were not
designed to “ﬁre” through anything, especially tiny symbols crammed
on clay tablets, papyrus, parchment, or paper. They are slow and tire
easily. All of these problems add up to a fourth: textual search as done
by humans is not very efﬁcient in terms of information retrieval. A
really efﬁcient search is one that yields just what you want and nothing
95

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

you don’t. Visual searches of text necessarily produce a lot of stuff you
don’t want and a little of what you do. When searching text, you are
going to do more looking than ﬁnding.
Text, then, is hard to search. If you don’t have it, you can’t search it.
If you do, the process is going to be slow, tiring, and yield more noise
than signal. Media that are hard to search generate unmapped networks,
that is, networks in which either no system of addresses exists or, if it
does, it is so incomplete that searching, ﬁnding, and retrieving stored
data is difﬁcult. Functionally, what this means is that data stored in an
unmapped network will tend to become concentrated in certain nodes
rather than being shared across many nodes. Some people will know
things that others do not. According to our theory, unmapped media
networks professionalize social practices realized in and around them.
Here “professionalize” means tending to generate experts and expertise,
that is, people who have – or claim to have – special knowledge and the
special knowledge itself. The reason is this: people who have unequal
access to information will often monopolize it in the hopes of increasing
their power; unmapped networks allow this sort of monopolization.
Early Manuscript Cultures provide a good example. In huntergatherer bands, most people experienced the same things: life itself did
not produce signiﬁcant inequalities of knowledge. Moreover, when one
person did gain (or claim) special knowledge, he or she was expected
to share it and, practically speaking, had to. This equalized knowledge
across the network. As humanity began to live in sedentary communities, and these communities were united in primitive states, stable
vertical and horizontal difference appeared, two being ranks and occupations. Differences in life engendered differences in knowledge. Most
of these “knowledges,” so to speak, remained oral, and they could
after a fashion be searched in the old way – remembering and asking
others to remember. In some cases, however, they were reduced to writing. For example, princes wrote laws and priests drafted scripture. The
practice spread: the Greeks – and all those who followed them – wrote
treaties on many of the major arts, crafts, and sciences.74 These writings
constituted the ﬁrst textual “disciplines.” Sometimes disciplinary texts
were gathered together in archives and libraries, and sometimes these
repositories were even opened to the public. By and large, however, the
disciplinary texts – which were, after all, valuable objects – were either
privately held or accessible only to those who were authorized and able
96

HOMO SCRIPTOR

to use them (that is, the small minority of the population that was literate). Ancient Judaism offers an example of restricted access to texts.
After giving Moses the law, God instructed him to build a fancy box to
put it in (Exodus 25: 10–22). This was the Arc of the Covenant. God
then told Moses to install the Arc in the Holy of Holies, a room within
the Tabernacle (Exodus 40: 3). There only the High Priest, Aaron,
brother of Moses, could enter and only on Yom Kippur (Leviticus 16).
From that point forward, the descendants of Aaron were known as the
Kohanim or “priests,” and the ofﬁce of High Priest remained in the
Aaronic line until the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans
in AD 70. For the Israelites, the Kohanim had a special dispensation
to keep the knowledge given to them by God. Writing enabled the
Kohanim to restrict access to the special knowledge that became the
basis of their authority. They could search it for meaning, and others
could not. Of course, they could not search it efﬁciently for all the reasons we mentioned earlier. Nonetheless, they had physical access – and
therefore power – and others did not.
Those who had special knowledge – professionals – recorded it in
writing and hoarded it. That was the “is” of the situation and remained
so until recently when, thanks to new media, expertise started to slip
out of the hands of the experts. The “ought” evolved to support the
emergence and existence of experts was, paradoxically, collectivism.
The basic notion here is that human groups are not composed of
autonomous individuals, as we saw was the case in the hunter-gatherer
band, but rather are structured by dependencies. The social parts, each
with its own function, work together to form the social whole. If one
fails, then they all suffer. It is a short step from this concept of society to
the idea that each social part has a divinely sanctioned obligation to the
collective. This is the origin of the doctrine of “estates,” as in “those who
pray” (clergy, the First Estate), “those who ﬁght” (nobility, the Second Estate), and “those who work” (peasants, the Third Estate). It is
most familiar from medieval Europe but was common throughout the
Manuscript Era.75

The same year Marshall McLuhan’s The Gutenberg Galaxy was published, an altogether different book was issued under the clever title
How to Do Things with Words.76 It was the work of the British
97

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

philosopher of language, J. L. Austin, who tragically died before his
time in 1960. Whereas McLuhan tried to demonstrate that writing
“restructured thought,” Austin sought to show that we do a lot of different things to other people with language. McLuhan may or may not
have been right, but Austin certainly was. We do, in fact, do many
different things to other people with words. Take a promise. It’s a tool
we use to create an obligation. Or a threat. It’s a tool we use to make
people fear us. Or a lie. It’s a tool we use to fool someone. There are
hundreds of other examples. We’ve tried to point out in this chapter
that writing, too, is a tool that we use – often if not exclusively – to
do things to other people, to structure social relations and convince
others that certain things are good or true. But writing doesn’t allow
us to do anything we like. Like any tool, it has more or less ﬁxed characteristics that permit some kinds of use and discourage others. Taken
together, we argued, these attributes predictably led to the formation
of certain sorts of media networks in the Manuscript Era, and these
networks predictably led to the evolution of certain social practices and
values. Table 3 sums up the entire theory as it concerns manuscriptwriting.
We need to keep ﬁrmly in our minds that writing doesn’t always
produce these effects or, where it does, always to the same extent. We
saw how the natural tendencies of speech could be blunted or even
scotched, though only with great effort. In principle, the same is true
of writing. One could make writing very accessible by means of free
schooling. One could make writing very public by forbidding private
reading and writing. One could make writing high-ﬁdelity by teaching

everyone to draw like an Old Master. One could increase writing’s
information-bearing capacity by making writing materials and the post
free. One could make writing faster by creating a fast postal service, or
even something like email. One could reduce the range of writing by
making it illegal to transport texts. One could diminish the persistence of
writing by instituting a universal burn-after-reading policy. One could
make writing highly searchable by constructing an exhaustive index of
everything written.
All this is possible, and some of it has even been attempted. But, as
the historical record suggests, deﬂecting the tendencies of manuscriptwriting takes a strength far beyond that possessed by most human
groups. History is littered with tyrants, despots, and dictators, but none
of them has ever had the power to reverse the currents of writing, at
least in the long term. Despite their best efforts, writing usually did
what writing naturally does. This is why Manuscript Cultures – despite
the enormous cultural differences that separated them – all share a
common set of characteristics. Princes and priests had access to literacy;
almost no one else did or for that matter wanted to. Elites used their
dominance of writing to privatize the secular and sacred, and everyone
agreed that this was right and proper. They employed writing to create
abstract models of the human and heavenly spheres, which in turn were
used to rationalize those spheres. They deemed writing precious, used it
sparingly, and put restrictions on its use. No one believed that one could
or should write anything. They “spoke” to their subjects via writing,
and their subjects almost never talked back. They employed writing as
a tool of empire and science, gathering data about strangers and the
strange. Thus their worlds expanded. They kept written records and
wove “histories” out of them. Thus the “past” appeared and was used
in the present. And they used writing to segment knowledge, thereby
creating “disciplines.” Thus did specialists gain power over laypeople
in many important matters. These characteristics can be found in the
Manuscript-Era cultures of the Ancient Near East, Classical Antiquity,
and medieval Europe. Indeed, they are common coin among all agrarian
societies wherever and whenever they are found.77
This, then, was Manuscript Culture, the product of manuscriptwriting and the organized interests that “pulled” it into being. It
proved quite durable and useful. For more than 4,000 years, Manuscript

99

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

Culture covered vast regions of the globe; with it, humans built enormous complex societies. In the following chapter, we’ll see how people
in one such society became dissatisﬁed with manuscripts and began to
look for new media. The result was the birth of print, and with it, Print
Culture.

Humanity in the Age of Print

The rulers will need to use a quite considerable amount of falsehood and
deception for the beneﬁt of those ruled. But we said, I think, that all such things
are useful only in the form of medicine.1
– Plato, The Republic, 459C

Plato believed that the only way to get to the Truth was by dialogue.
Stentorian monologues wouldn’t do the job, and neither would fancy
writing. You had to talk to someone if you were really going to get to
the bottom of anything. But talking wasn’t all you had to do. Anyone
could talk. In order to pursue philosophy, Plato said, you also had to
have the right intellectual stuff. You needed to be smart and love –
really love – the Truth. These intellectual and emotional characteristics
were, however, rare. Only a few people possessed them, so only a few
people were really cut out to be philosophers. To Plato, that was just
a natural fact. In The Republic, he used this fact as the linchpin of
his social engineering program. There he argued that the easiest way
to create an ideal city was to put naturally superior people in charge,
that is, those with the right intellectual stuff and a love of the Truth.
The trick, of course, was ﬁnding and educating them. Thus, most of
The Republic is given over to an explanation of how they might be
discovered and raised. Once the philosopher-kings were found, trained,
and placed over the citizenry, Plato claimed, the city would naturally
ﬂourish.
A knotty question, however, remained. Plato valued the Truth. He
believed the pursuit of it was humanity’s highest calling. He probably
wished that everyone could have the capacity to ﬁnd it, but as we’ve
seen, he didn’t believe this was so. Some did, some didn’t. Clearly those
101

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

who did should rule the ideal city, but should they tell the rest – the
ignorant common people – what the Truth was? Didn’t they have a right
to know what was really going on? Plato didn’t think so. Given their
imperfect mental abilities and meager educations, they would just be
confused by the Truth and their perplexity would disrupt the harmony
of the city. In order to preserve said harmony, Plato recommended strict
censorship and carefully crafted propaganda. What should the masses
be told? Fairy tales like the cynical “Myth of the Metals” (Republic,
414B–415D). All people, so the fable goes, are brothers and sisters
insofar as they are born of the earth. But they are not all equal. Not at
all. Some are gold, some are silver, and some are iron and bronze, each
being less precious than the last. Accordingly, those made of gold are
rulers; those made of silver, auxiliaries; and those of iron and bronze,
commoners. The lesson is transparent, as is its utility to the elite: the
mighty are mighty and the meek are meek because that’s the way nature
intended it. Sensing that the meek might ﬁnd the permanence of their
sorry lot a bit disheartening, Plato offers them hope. It could happen, he
says with a wink, that even though you are bronze your son or daughter
might be gold, and if that is the case he or she will automatically be
welcomed into the ruling class. Naturally, he adds rather more honestly,
that probably won’t happen, so don’t get your hopes up and get back
to work.
Plato’s open embrace of censorship and propaganda may seem a
bit odd to us, but they were common coin among the ruling elite of
Manuscript Cultures. In that world, power rested on writing, and writing rested in the hands of the powerful. In this chapter, we will see what
happened when the written word partially escaped from the elite’s grasp
for the ﬁrst time in world history. With the spread of print and literacy in early modern and modern Europe, the hierarchs of old could no
longer monopolize writing as they had for almost 5,000 years. They lost
control of knowledge, and they lost control of the Truth. The results,
as we’ll see, were somewhat different than Plato anticipated.

why we print
If we are to show that our “pull” theory of media evolution is correct
in the instance of print (and, just to be clear, we mean the “Print
Revolution” that began in the West after 1450), we must prove two
102

HOMO LECTOR

historical theses. First, we must show that the technical ability to print
preexisted printing by some longish period. If this turns out to be true,
then we can say that people could have printed in the modern way but
didn’t because they didn’t need to or, rather, didn’t need to enough.
Second, we must show that some major social change made existing
media – talking and writing – insufﬁcient for the purposes of some
organized group or groups, and that this or these groups developed
a preexisting technical capacity – the ability to print – into a fully
articulated medium.
What evidence, primary and secondary, can be brought to bear on
these two theses? The primary evidence is plentiful, indeed, almost too
much so. The libraries and archives of older Print Cultures – particularly
those in Western Europe – are overﬂowing with millions upon millions
of sources on printing and literacy. Historians generally love books, so
it’s not surprising that they have paid considerable attention to their
production and consumption. Thanks to their efforts, we know much
about the origin of print technology;2 the birth of European print;3
the early modern “Print Revolution”;4 talking in the age of print;5
writing in the age of print;6 the print business;7 clandestine print;8 the
censorship of print;9 print, education, and literacy;10 and the origin of
mass literacy.11 In short, the ground has been well covered. We will
take advantage of this fact in all that follows.
Printing before Printing

We could have written thousands of years before we actually wrote.
Given the utility of writing in our own age, that must strike us as strange.
But it’s true. The case is rather different with printing. Not only could
we have printed long before Gutenberg, we actually did after a fashion,
though without the consequences that attended Gutenberg’s invention.
That must strike us as even stranger. But it’s true, too.
Actually, Gutenberg didn’t “invent” a whole heck of a lot. Almost
all the elements of his printing system – the idea of stamping, movable type, a mechanical press, durable ink, and a stable medium – were
present long before he set up shop. The basic concept behind printing –
that you could use a crafted object to make a standard, reasonably
permanent impression or mark on a surface – is ancient.12 We’ll begin
with stamping. All early civilizations used seals and stamps, usually as
103

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

authentication devices. The use of this technology to print texts is also
old. By the ﬁfth century at the latest, the Chinese were using carved
stone to print text; by the eighth century at the latest, they were using
woodblocks for the same purpose. In what was to become a typical pattern of diffusion, woodblock printing spread to Central Asia, then to
the Islamic and Byzantine worlds, and ﬁnally to Europe. This printing
technique was common in Europe by the fourteenth century, though it
was almost always used to reproduce images. As for movable type, the
Romans used it to create raised text on lead pipes, but never employed
it to print on light media. The industrious Chinese used both clay and
wooden movable type in the eleventh century. Korean craftsmen are
generally credited with the creation of the ﬁrst metal movable type,
made of bronze, in the early ﬁfteenth century. Movable type made it to
Central Asia, but seemingly no further, though texts printed with movable type may have been seen by medieval European travelers. In the
Manuscript Era, mechanical presses were ubiquitous and came in many
varieties – beam, lever, and roller among them. The Romans invented
the kind Gutenberg used, the screw press, in the ﬁrst century. It was in
widespread use in Europe by the year 1000, particularly in wine and
olive oil production. Ink was also ubiquitous and came in many varieties in the Manuscript Era. Every literate civilization seemed to have
its own favorite recipe – usually some combination of natural pigments,
soot, gum, and water – but they all had it. Here, though, Gutenberg
may be credited with a genuine invention. Traditional water-based inks
didn’t work well with his metal movable type, so he created a specially designed oil-based ink for printing. Finally, the Chinese invented
paper in the ﬁrst century. Over the next several centuries, it spread to
Korea, Japan, and Central Asia. It migrated to the Islamic world in the
eighth century, and from there to Europe in twelfth century. By the time
Gutenberg set up his printing business, there were dozens of paper mills
operating all over the continent, and paper had become a medium of
choice.
Not only were the technologies required to print large numbers of
texts at hand centuries before Gutenberg, in at least one instance they –
or rather a subset of them – were put to exactly that use.13 As we said,
the Chinese were making rubbings from stone and wooden inscriptions
well before the end of the ﬁrst millennium AD. Prior to the eighth
century, however, these techniques were not reengineered and deployed
104

HOMO LECTOR

for the purposes of mass production because the Chinese “scribal pool,”
so to speak, was large enough to reproduce everything that needed
to be reproduced. In the early eighth century, however, the Empress
Wu (r. 690–705) ordered the mass reproduction and distribution of
short Buddhist texts by means of woodblock printing. In ﬁts and starts
over the next several centuries, both a state-sponsored and independent
printing industry grew. Wooden movable type became common in the
twelfth century. Millions upon millions of texts were printed and found
their way all over East Asia.
Yet there was no “Print Revolution” in East Asia. In Europe, the
introduction of print was associated with a massive increase in the
amount of text produced, in the speed with which texts circulated, and
in the proportion of the population that could read them. In East Asia,
it was associated with none of these things. Why the difference? One
commonly cited explanation – that the Chinese script or the woodblock
method made printing inefﬁcient14 – can immediately be dismissed. If
that were so, then printed matter would not have been so inexpensive
and plentiful in early modern China, and we know it was both.15 No,
there must be something else that paved the way for the odd explosion of
print in Europe, something absent not only in East Asia but throughout
the entire world.
This may have been a growing audience for text, and therefore growing demand. We have it on good authority that manuscript production –
almost always religious – in the late medieval period was increasing.16
There is also some indication, if rather uncertain due to lack of sources,
that the era witnessed an increase in manuscript book ownership.17
More books in more hands doesn’t necessarily mean there were more
readers doing more reading. But we also know that in some parts of
Europe – particularly the Northwest – parishes and towns were opening
more elementary and grammar schools.18 This has led some to infer, not
illogically though in the absence of anything like direct evidence, that
literacy was increasing in the century or two before Gutenberg opened
up his business.19
“Pulling” Print into Existence

New media are born of rising demand, and the evidence just presented
concerning the expansion of the lay readership in late medieval Europe
105

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

would certainly suggest rising demand. But that, according to our theory, is not really enough. The interests that stimulate and meet rising
demand must be organized. In the Manuscript Era, the ﬁrst such organized interests were Mesopotamian princes and priests. In the Print Era,
they were Northwestern European capitalists, bureaucrats, and pastors.
Each of these groups found reason to be dissatisﬁed with manuscripts
as a means of communication, and each of them promoted – albeit
irregularly – the adoption of print.
We’ll begin with the capitalists.20 Trade in most centralized
Manuscript Cultures was severely restricted, both in the sense that it
was dominated by political elites and starved for investment capital.
These constraints made it hard for entrepreneurs to open new markets,
and harder still to raise the funds necessary to exploit them. In medieval
and early modern Europe, however, things were different. Thanks to
the legacy of feudalism, political power there was divided among thousands of overlapping sovereignties and semi-sovereignties. At the top
there were empires, below them kingdoms, then principalities, then
duchies, then baronages, then counties, then domains – not to mention
free cities, monasteries, colleges, universities, and guilds, all of which
had some measure of autonomy. On the one hand, the jumble of jurisdictions divided markets. On the other hand, “Balkanization” ensured
that no central authority could completely dominate all markets. Since
each sovereignty was interested in increasing its tax revenue, and since
tax revenue came primarily from imposts on trade, European authorities
high and low found themselves competing for trade income. They could
pursue a course of protectionism, capturing trade within their borders
by imposing trade barriers. But the smarter move was to provide an economic climate conducive to commercial activity. The Northern Italian
city-states – Venice, Milan, Florence, Genoa – did this most effectively
in the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries. They were succeeded by the
commercial cities of the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century,
and then London in the eighteenth. In order to take full advantage of
new opportunities, European entrepreneurs, usually with the backing
of political elites, invented new ﬁnancial institutions to promote economic growth. These are now familiar to us, but were innovative in
the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries when they ﬁrst appeared: the commercial bank, the joint stock company, the insurance agency, and the
entire ﬁnancial infrastructure of a modern mercantile economy. With
106

HOMO LECTOR

markets comparatively open and capital available, economic growth
ensued. Thus, a new form of mass economic cooperation evolved –
mercantile capitalism. Indeed, it evolved so rapidly that by 1776, one
Adam Smith could lay down its basic laws in a book called An Inquiry
into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.21
Now let’s turn to the bureaucrats.22 As we’ve said, Manuscript Cultures were generally ruled by princes and priests. So were medieval and
early modern European societies for the most part, but there princes
and priests found it necessary to ask for a lot of help, so much that
it eventually compelled them to reorganize the way they did business.
Beginning in the seventeenth century, the costs of maintaining a competitive European sovereignty increased dramatically. This was in part due
to “push” factors and in part to “pull” factors. In the former class we
can cite rising military costs. Beginning in the sixteenth century, European states entered into an arms race that would last, intermittently,
until the Second World War. In order to remain viable on the champs de
mars, they had to build bigger, better equipped, better trained armies,
navies, and eventually air forces than had ever been seen in the history
of the world. Failure to do so meant extinction, or at least relegation to
the rank of a second-class power, so all parties concerned took the race
seriously. As everyone knows, armies are expensive, so in order to raise
them, early modern European monarchs found they had to construct
large organizations to extract the taxes necessary to pay for them and
to recruit, arm, and train those in them. These were the ﬁrst modern
bureaucracies in Europe. As for “pull” factors, the same European elites
who busied themselves building up their armies also took an interest in
“improving” the societies from which those armies were raised. The two
went hand in hand. In addition, a number of ideological currents stimulated their desire to use the state as an engine of social improvement.
Among them we can name: Humanism, with its emphasis on education; Republicanism, with its focus on training good citizens; Cameralism, centered on the notion that the state should be well-ordered; and
eventually Socialism, concentrating on the improvement of the material
conditions of the downtrodden. We should of course mention Christianity itself, with its sundry duties to be merciful, just, and kind in
the service of God. Whatever their motivation, early modern European
rulers, particularly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, embarked
on “enlightened” campaigns of social improvement. They built roads,
107

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

founded schools and universities, opened hospitals and orphanages,
created postal services, reformed this, reformed that, and generally regulated everything they could. Their efforts may not have resulted in the
hoped-for social progress, but they always produced large bureaucracies. These organizations had grown so bulky and intrusive by the end of
the eighteenth century that they inspired spirited critiques such as that
penned by the proto-anarchist William Godwin’s in 1793, An Enquiry
Concerning Political Justice and its Inﬂuence on Modern Morals and
Manners.23
Finally, we have the pastors.24 In many Manuscript Cultures, only
priests (or those in their employ) could read, and only they were
expected to read the holy scriptures. Indeed, much of their authority stemmed from the fact that they and they alone could read. All this
was true of the Catholic and Orthodox Christian Churches of the High
Middle Ages. That changed with the coming of the Reformation in
1517. Luther told his followers that scripture alone (sola scriptura) was
the source of revealed truth and that they must, therefore, understand it
if they wanted to receive the word of God. That meant reading it, something Catholic and Orthodox theologians almost universally believed
was a bad idea. To facilitate reading by commoners, Luther himself
translated the Bible into German, another no-no. Not surprisingly, it
sold like hot cakes after it was printed in 1522. In the ﬁrst two years
of production alone, it was printed in fourteen authorized and sixty-six
pirated editions.25 Many other translations into the vernacular followed
as Luther’s “priesthood of all believers” grew. The Protestants’ call to
read and interpret the Bible had many effects, but the most interesting, organizationally speaking, was the fragmentation of Christianity
itself. Not only did Protestantism hive off Catholicism and Orthodoxy,
but it splintered into dozens and today hundreds of loosely aligned
sub-denominations. If any believer can receive the divine word directly
through the Bible, then it follows that any believer can found his or
her own church based on his or her own revelation. And many, many
have. In addition to Lutherans, of which there are many kinds, there
are Calvinists, Anabaptists, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Pietists, Baptists,
Methodists, Quakers, Pentecostals, Adventists, and Congregationalists,
among others. The number of nameless, forgotten storefront Protestant churches past and present is too large to count. Protestantism isn’t
really an “organized religion” at all. It’s less a church than a network
108

HOMO LECTOR

of churches, less a faith than a discussion of faith, less a dogma than a
stand against dogma.
The simultaneous rise of mercantile capitalism, the bureaucratic
state, and reading religion in early modern Europe provided the historical context within which Print Culture could evolve, for each of these
new developments stimulated the learning of letters and the adoption
of print.
Mercantile capitalism required literacy to operate effectively. Think
about the paper trail that capitalist production and exchange leaves:
catalogues, contracts, sureties, indemnities, orders, delivery schedules,
transit papers, bills of lading, inventories, receipts, invoices, account
books, tax documents, bank statements, and so on. Reading and writing
became a cost of doing business in early modern Europe, and businessmen actively patronized the schools and universities that produced the
literate workers they needed. Print offered traders compelling efﬁciencies. First of all, it enabled them to inexpensively distribute news about
markets or political conditions that might affect markets.26 Manuscript
newsletters with a commercial bent had been circulating in Europe for
some time when the ﬁrst printed proto-newspapers appeared in the
sixteenth century. They included reports on commodity and currency
prices, items of obvious interest to businessmen. By the ﬁrst quarter
of the seventeenth century, periodical newspapers were to be found
in many major European cities, including Basel, Frankfurt, Vienna,
Hamburg, Berlin, Amsterdam, Antwerp, and London. They continued
to spread in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries until they virtually
covered the continent and were read by millions.
Similarly, bureaucracy necessitated literacy to run right. Modern
ofﬁces process a huge amount and many different kinds of paper: laws,
regulations, guidelines, directives, writs, summons, warrants, reports,
white papers, memos, registers, indexes, and so on. Administrators must
be literate to work in this environment, as is true of those who are
administered. Thus, states became heavily involved in not only training
literate bureaucrats, but making sure subjects themselves could read and
write. For this purpose they opened and patronized countless schools
and academies. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, improving
states launched full-blown literacy campaigns.27 Print also provided
new opportunities for states and their administrators, principally as a
means of public announcement and propaganda. Print allowed edicts,
109

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

regulations, and law codes to be distributed far and wide at reasonably low cost, something difﬁcult – though hardly impossible – in a
Manuscript Culture. Moreover, print could be used to shape emergent public opinion. Early modern rulers knew, of course, that some of
their subjects read books and newspapers, so they regulated and censored both aggressively (just as Plato suggested they should). In principle, nothing could be printed without a government-issued license, and
nothing distributed unless it had gone through the hands of a censor.
Naturally, printers were careful not to run afoul of the powers-thatwere, and therefore usually printed items that were favorable to them.
A more aggressive tact was for the state to use a newspaper as a semiofﬁcial mouthpiece for the government line. This was not as difﬁcult as
you might imagine. Since the government was the source of most of the
really valuable news anyway, all it had to do was make a sweetheart
deal with a particular newspaper to get its bidding done. Throughout
the entire early modern period, governmental administrations fed newspapers in this way to make sure that their message got out. American
presidents had their own semi-ofﬁcial newspapers in Washington until
the mid-nineteenth century.28 Russian leaders still do.29
Finally, reading religion naturally needs literacy to do its godly work.
Luther himself went back and forth on the issue of whether every
believer was “priest” enough to interpret scripture in his or her own
way. But he let the cat out of the bag, so there was little he or any
Protestant theologian could do to stop the lay priests from reading the
Bible – if, of course, they could read. Luther’s followers went to signiﬁcant lengths to see that they could. Throughout the early modern
period, Protestant sects subsidized existing schools and founded new
ones precisely for the purpose of teaching the faithful to read. They
had, however, a rather limited view on what the faithful should read,
as anyone who’s been to Sunday school will know. The Reformation
prompted the Counter-Reformation, and Catholics soon got into the
literacy business as well. The Jesuits can be credited with the creation
of the ﬁrst “school system” in Europe in the sixteenth century, and they
still consider education to be one of their primary missions. Europeans
of every confessional stripe also had a stake in printing, for it seemed to
be an excellent way to propagate the faith or, from the Catholic point
of view, to prevent the propagation of the new faith. Luther was probably the ﬁrst living author to become a bestseller in print. His many
110

HOMO LECTOR

pamphlets quickly sold out, went through multiple printings, and were
widely translated. By one estimate, Luther’s thirty publications between
1517 and 1520 sold “well over 300,000 copies.”30 Luther is reported
to have called print “God’s highest and most extreme act of grace,
whereby the business of the Gospel is driven forward.”31 During and
after the Counter-Reformation, Catholics also embraced the printing
press, so long as it was used to publish approved texts. Just so everyone
would know which books were evil, the Papacy regularly printed lists of
proscribed texts, the famed and feared Index Librorum Prohibitorum.
If you printed, possessed, or read a book on the Index, you were asking
to be summoned to the Inquisition. Catholics took printing and reading
seriously: the Index was not abandoned until 1966, and then with great
reluctance.32
The unprecedented conﬂuence of capitalism, bureaucracy, and reading religion in early modern Europe lead to the explosion of the world’s
ﬁrst Print Culture. Gutenberg opened the ﬁrst European print shop of
which we have record in Mainz around 1439. The shop failed, but
the press was a success.33 By 1480, there were printing presses in 110
Western European towns; by 1500, they were in 236. As the sixteenth
century drew to a close, presses were to be found throughout the continent and overseas as well. The ﬁrst substantial book printed by modern
methods was Gutenberg’s famous 42-line Bible of 1454. More quickly
followed. Something on the order of 30,000 editions (that is, separate
titles) were published in Europe before 1500, though some of these were
pamphlets rather than books. It’s estimated that somewhere between
150,000 and 200,000 editions (again, separate titles) were printed in
the sixteenth century. Gutenberg printed approximately 200 copies of
the 42-line Bible. The number of books increased suddenly and dramatically thereafter. Bibliographers believe that some 20 million books were
printed before 1500, and between 150 million and 200 million in the
sixteenth century. Given that the population of Europe outside Russia
and the Ottoman Empire was roughly 78 million in 1600, that’s three
books for every person then living.34 They were not, however, evenly
distributed. Only the well-heeled could afford books until the eighteenth
century, and only they were likely to be able to read. But there was a
ﬂood of cheaper printed material that was within the reach of the literate (and listening) middle and lower classes. These items generally took
the form of broadsheets and chapbooks – ephemeral texts that catered
111

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

to the tastes of common people, that is, reported miracles, mysteries,
monstrous births, and the sort of thing one often ﬁnds in tabloid newspapers today. They were not meant to last, and for the most part they
haven’t. We have no idea exactly how many were printed. All we can
say is that there were probably a lot of them. The same holds true in
part for printed proto-newspapers and newspapers. They ﬁrst appeared
in the mid-sixteenth century as single-event newssheets and quickly
evolved into periodicals covering many events. The ﬁrst weekly newspaper appeared in Paris in 1631, in Florence in 1636, in Rome in 1640,
and in Madrid in 1661. The ﬁrst daily was issued in Leipzig in 1660.
There were over 200 newspapers in operation in the German-speaking
regions of Europe in the seventeenth century. Paris had 35 periodicals
in 1779; by 1789, it had 169. London had 169 periodicals in 1779; by
1789, it had 205. It’s estimated that 16,500 newspapers were printed
daily in London in the mid-eighteenth century. In 1712, there was one
stamped (taxed) newspaper printed for every two adults in England; in
1760, there were three for every two; and in 1800, there were three for
every adult.
Literacy rates grew as well. Before we see how, we need to bear
in mind that measuring literacy is a complicated business, particularly
before the twentieth century. Though we often speak of people or populations as being more or less literate, “literacy” is not just a single
dimension. Rather, it is a set of skills, all of which can be mastered to a
greater or lesser degree, often independently of one another. You don’t
need to know how to write in order to read, and you don’t need to be
a good reader in order to sound out words. We need to be aware of
these differences when we speak of “literacy.” Moreover, Manuscriptand Print-Era societies did not administer standardized tests to measure
reading and writing ability. In fact, they generally didn’t measure reading and writing ability at all. Therefore, historians must rely on proxies
of various kinds that suggest to various degrees how many people were
literate and to what extent. These proxies fall into two categories: indirect measures such as the number of schools, production and sale of
books, and property inventories including books; and direct measures
such as the ability to sign one’s name. Even here there is a lot of room
for error: going to school doesn’t necessarily mean learning to read,
and signing one’s name doesn’t necessarily mean one can write. When
estimating literacy rates, we should always recall the distance between
112

HOMO LECTOR

the imperfect tool we use to measure reading and writing and the actual
rates of reading and writing.
Having said all that, both indirect and direct measures strongly suggest that literacy made signiﬁcant advances during the early modern
period, particularly in Northwest Europe. The number of primary and
secondary schools grew, at ﬁrst ad hoc and then as a result of direct state
intervention in education. According to one estimate, between one-ﬁfth
and one-third of all children in Western Europe had the opportunity to
attend school in the eighteenth century. In Northwestern Europe and
areas such as Prussia, the ﬁgure topped 50 percent.35 As for higher education, it too experienced signiﬁcant growth. Spain, for example, had six
universities in 1450 and thirty-three by 1600. In the German-speaking
lands, there were twenty universities in 1600, twenty-eight by 1700,
and thirty-one by 1760. In England, Oxford and Cambridge remained
the only two universities, but even they expanded by adding numerous
new colleges. All in all, more than 184 universities were in operation
at one time or another in early modern Europe. The number of college students rose. The University of Padua matriculated 300 students
a year in the 1550s; by the 1610s, that number had reached 1,100.
Cambridge University enrolled some 1,300 students in 1564; in 1622,
it enrolled 3,000. The German universities taught 3,200 students in
1500; by 1600, they taught 8,000. Part of the rise in enrollments was
due to increases in the general population, but the rate of university
attendance was growing as well. About 1 percent of Western Europeans attended university circa 1500. A century later, that ﬁgure had
increased to around 2.4 percent in England and 2.8 percent in the United
Provinces of the Low Countries. It’s true that the attendance rate rose
and fell from decade to decade, but the general trend was probably
slightly upward. More primary, secondary, and tertiary students meant
more readers, and more readers meant higher demand for printed material. We’ve already seen that the number of printed books, newspapers,
and ephemeral items grew rapidly over the entire period. The price
of printed matter declined continuously, and as a result, ownership of
printed text spread throughout society. Owning a book was virtually
unthinkable for most Europeans around 1500; by 1800, it was quite
common. Reading spread more quickly and widely than writing, but
writing itself made signiﬁcant gains. According to one estimate, more
than 50 percent of adult males in Northwestern Europe could sign their
113

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

names in 1800. More could read a simple text. As the state became
more heavily involved in education in the nineteenth century, literacy
rates continued to climb until most adults could read and write at least
on a basic level.36
Printing and Human Nature

Mass literacy, largely built on the power of print to provide texts and the
state to make people learn to read and write, arrived in Western Europe
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and then spread to much of
the rest of the world in the twentieth century. It was, however, a long
time coming. People could print long before the Print Era, but generally
they didn’t use print as a means of mass textual reproduction. Even
when they did, as in the case of early modern China and Renaissance
Europe, people did not rush to learn to read. And, even more strikingly,
when European states made literacy training both available and indeed
mandatory, people still avoided literacy. Why?
The answer is essentially the same one we gave for the remarkably
late arrival and low penetration of manuscript literacy: humans really
don’t like to read and write very much. As we said, we were evolved
to talk – that’s why it is easy for us and we so like to do it. We were
not evolved to write or read – that’s why we ﬁnd both so difﬁcult
and tiring. These facts did not change with the arrival of printing in
China, Europe or anywhere else. We have no natural inclination to
read manuscripts, and we have no natural inclination to read printed
texts. Printing produced more texts and the state provided – indeed
mandated – that people learn to read them. But neither the one nor the
other could make reading any more useful or enjoyable.
Again, we tend to think that if people are given the chance to learn to
read, they will learn. We also are inclined to think that if, once literate,
they are given some good reason to read or something interesting to
read, they will read it. In the Manuscript and Print Eras we could not
test these propositions. But in our own age we can and, in effect, already
have. For the past century at the very least, both of the previously
mentioned conditions – inexpensive literacy training and useful, cheap
reading material – have been met over all of the industrialized world
and much of the rest of it. Yet a remarkable number of people are still
illiterate. According to a recent UNESCO report, around 18 percent of
114

HOMO LECTOR

the world’s adults can’t read or write at all.37 Most of them live in places
where the state’s educational arm does not reach very far, Central Africa
being the primary though not only example. But even in the developed
and developing world, a small but stubborn percentage of people choose
not to learn to read or write even though doing so is free and valuable.
More compelling is the fact that even when people can read, they don’t,
at least not very often. In a 2002 survey, 43 percent of adult Americans
reported that they had not voluntarily read a book in the past year.38
According to the American Time Use Survey (2007), adults in the United
States spend on average about twenty minutes every day reading on
weekdays for pleasure.39 They spend about twenty-three minutes on
weekends and holidays. Since Americans spend roughly three hours
a day watching television, it might make sense to say that humans
have some sort of evolutionarily implanted appetite for watching. But
it is crystal clear that we have no such ingrained hunger for reading –
whether the text is written by hand or printed.
The needs of capitalists, bureaucrats, and pastors “pulled” mass
printing and mass literacy into existence, but they could never really
complete the job because, as we’ve said, most people don’t like to read
or write very much.

what print did
In early modern Europe, then, what was a mixed-media environment
characterized by talking and manuscripts became even more mixed by
the addition of mass print. Again, we need to stress that mass print did
not replace talking or manuscripts. Major media generally accumulate;
they do not supplant one another. We also should emphasize that mass
print did not at any point or in any place become the predominant mode
of communications. For several centuries after the introduction of mass
print, literacy rates remained low. People who can’t read – and that
was the majority of the European population until the late nineteenth
century – do not read manuscripts or printed texts. They talk. Orality,
though not primary orality, survived well into the modern era even
where print and literacy spread fastest and penetrated most deeply.40
And even among people who were literate, talking and manuscripts
hardly disappeared once printing and printed matter became widely
available. For many – and perhaps even most – purposes, it remained
115

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

easier to talk to someone than to write a note to them, and easier to
write a note to them than to print one. For example, people continued
to write letters after print.41 Erasmus wrote about 2,000 of them;42
Linnaeus wrote over 2,400;43 Darwin wrote over 7700.44
According to our “push” theory of media effects, print should have
altered Manuscript Era social practices and values in these cultures; it
should have formed the basis of a distinct Print Culture in a distinct
Print Era (1450 to 1850). As we saw earlier, we have ample primary
and secondary sources available to test these propositions, and we will
use both in all that follows.
Accessibility

The cost of acquiring the equipment and skill necessary to talk and
listen is low, meaning speech is highly accessible. In contrast, the cost of
gaining the equipment and skill required to write and read manuscripts
is high, particularly in marginal economies, meaning manuscript literacy
is inaccessible. Traditional printing – that is, reproduction with a press,
movable type, ink, and paper – falls somewhere between the two.
On the send side, the tools and skills required to print are costly. The
equipment needed – a building, a press, movable type, frames, paper,
and ink – to run even a primitive printing operation are not cheap; modern printing presses, the kind used by book publishers and newspapers,
are hugely expensive. Once you have the equipment, you’ve got to learn
to use it. That means, ﬁrst of all, learning to write and read in the printed
language. That takes years. Then you have to learn how to operate the
printing machine. That will take more time. Once you’ve learned to use
it, you’ve got to use it. Printing presses are complicated, need ongoing
maintenance, and are subject to frequent breakdowns. All in all, they
are not a lot of fun to operate. It’s hardly surprising, then, that few
people use printing presses when they want to relax, the way someone might sing a song or write a letter. Printing, then, is an expensive
proposition. Moreover, it’s not terribly difﬁcult to make it artiﬁcially
more expensive than it naturally is. This is because printing presents
would-be monopolists with a fair – though not excellent – logistical
bottleneck, that is, a place in the production chain that is narrow and
therefore easily dominated. With printing, the bottleneck is precisely
access to printing equipment and skill. Tyrannical governments restrict
116

HOMO LECTOR

access to both. There is something about printing that makes tyrants
nervous.
On the receive side, the equipment and skills necessary to read printed
texts are comparatively inexpensive. The primary tool necessary for
reading is the text itself (though eyeglasses and a good light source
are also helpful). Since the printing press can produce texts quickly
and inexpensively, it drives down the cost of this reading material. The
press has the potential to put texts in the hands of the many, rather
than – as in Manuscript Culture – the few. The primary skill necessary
for reading is, well, reading ability. The press does not have any direct
impact on the cost of literacy training, though it did have an indirect
effect insofar as it made text more abundant and therefore increased
the opportunity to study reading. A manuscript literacy primer was
probably more expensive than a printed literacy primer. Also, it is
reasonably difﬁcult to make obtaining printed texts and learning to
read them more expensive than it naturally is. Once printed texts slip
through the bottleneck (as we’ll see they frequently do), they are a
lot like water that has run over a levee. If you block it here, it will
ﬂow over there. Try to pick it up, and it runs through your ﬁngers.
Even totalitarian states have trouble keeping books out of the hands of
their subjects. This is primarily because printed texts – like all texts –
are easily hidden and can be passed through “private” channels, a
topic we will discuss later. As for learning to read, pretty much anyone
who can read can teach someone who can’t. So if there are a lot of
readers, then it will be expensive to prevent the teaching and learning
of literacy. The passage of reading skills is a bit like the passage of
secrets: they move stealthily and it’s hard to tell just by looking who has
them.
Printing, then, would seem to be inaccessible on the send side and
accessible on the receive side. But it’s clear that the accessibility of print
changed radically over time, at least in the early modern and modern
West. It began as relatively inaccessible – few printers, small print runs,
few readers – and became much more accessible – many printers, larger
print runs, more readers. For this reason, we’ll treat it in its mature form
as accessible on both the send and receive sides. According to our theory,
accessible media engender diffuse networks, and diffuse networks tend
to equalize the social practices and values that grow with them. We’ll
see this was the case in the early modern and modern West.
117

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

In late medieval Europe, the elite – princes and priests – controlled
manuscript production de facto and de jure, just as we would expect
in any Manuscript Culture. When printing was introduced, they made
every effort to dominate it as well, again as we would expect. By the early
sixteenth century, nearly every European state had imposed a scheme
to license and censor the logistical bottleneck in the printing system –
presses and printers. By and large, these attempts at monopolization
proved reasonably effective in that they limited who could print and
what could be printed. Hierarchy was thereby maintained. Nonetheless, the princes and priests eventually lost control of the press because
it was just too slippery. This proved to be so for a number of reasons. First, it was generally easy to move printed texts across Europe’s
many borders. If a European printer couldn’t print something in one
jurisdiction, he could always go to another and export his product. Second, really aggressive attempts to control the press were impossible or
unreasonably expensive, both economically and politically. The best an
English king or Dutch Stadtholder could muster was a low-cost licensing and censorship system under which the printers’ and booksellers’
guilds policed themselves. As this complaint regarding illegal printing
issued by Parliament in 1643 indicates, it often didn’t work.
Very many, as well stationer and printers as others of sundry other professions
not free of the Stationers’ Company, have taken to set up sundry private
printing presses in corners, and to print, vent, publish and disperse books,
pamphlets and papers in such multitudes that no industry could be sufﬁcient
to discover or bring to punishment all the several abounding delinquents.45

According to one estimate, as many as a third of all books in early
seventeenth-century England were unauthorized.46 Finally, good control of the press wasn’t really good enough. You needed to get them all.
Effectively censoring ninety-nine out of one hundred presses sounds like
a job well done, but a single press – producing thousands of copies –
could do a lot of damage.
It took some time, then, for the European elite to lose their hold on
printers. In contrast, they almost immediately lost all control of readers. The Inquisition and similar censoring bodies might have worked
in the Manuscript Era, when both texts and readers were few. But in
early modern Europe, this was not the case. The facts were simple.
Demand for written material was steadily rising as Western Europeans
118

HOMO LECTOR

became wealthier, more literate, and increasingly accustomed to having
their textual tastes gratiﬁed. Supply followed rising demand thanks to a
healthy, responsive, and sometimes devious printing industry. Readers
and printed texts multiplied. The result was the slow but steady democratization of reading, especially though not exclusively in Northwestern
Europe. Remember that print production presented a bottleneck the
elite could exploit – printers, few in number and easy to ﬁnd, could
be hounded and their presses destroyed. But in a world of millions of
readers and millions of texts, the consumption of print offered no easy
chokepoint. Russians have a nice expression: “A word is not a sparrow. Once you’ve let it go, you can’t get it back.”47 The same might
be said of printed texts. Once they have escaped into the public, they
cannot be easily retrieved. This was obviously true in the countries of
early modern Western Europe (and later North America) where both
custom and law prevented the state from illegal searches and seizures
of property, and especially property found in one’s residence. But it
was also true in despotisms where such customs and laws, though they
might be on the books, were not respected. Both the Russian and, later,
Soviet governments did their best to censor what their subjects read;
still, underground literature was widely available in both.48
The democratization of printing and reading in early modern Europe
had a profound impact on a number of social practices, but clearly
the most signiﬁcant was on the social practice of government. In the
Manuscript Era, princes and priests monopolized writing and reading
and were able, then, to use text as an instrument of control. In the
Print Era, their monopoly was broken and the instrument based on it
destroyed. Suddenly the ruling elite’s “voice” was one among many,
albeit the strongest. Parties, confessions, regions, towns, classes, business interests, guilds, and all the other component parts of traditional
societies could now “speak,” not only to power but to each other. And
“speak” – or rather argue – they did in the host of religious, political,
and politico-religious conﬂicts that punctuated the early modern period:
the Reformation, the English Revolution, the Dutch Revolt, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution, to name only the most signiﬁcant. Each of these contretemps generated a ﬂood of partisan printed
material: discourses, treatises, tracts, broadsides, chapbooks, ballads,
pamphlets, and newspapers. Many of them, like Locke’s famous Two
Treatises of Government, are still read today.49 It was out of this new
119

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

chorus of voices that limited monarchy emerged, and out of limited
monarchy that liberal democracy as we know it today emerged. To be
sure, the accessibility of print did not uniquely “cause” the birth of free
government, but it surely served as its midwife.50
That was the “is” of the situation: by the eighteenth century at the
latest, the Western European elite’s hold on text slipped away and with
it the elite’s hold on power. The “ought” moved from one stating that
the press should be licensed and restricted – elitism – to one stating
that the press should be free – a sort of egalitarianism.51 The new
“ought” manifested itself in many forms, but among the most important
was the doctrine of the “marketplace of ideas”: the notion that the
truth is best arrived at through an open exchange of opinions. Milton
famously laid it out in 1644: “And though all the windes of doctrin
were let loose to play upon the earth, so Truth be in the ﬁeld, we do
injuriously, by licencing and prohibiting to misdoubt her strength. Let
her and Falshood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the wors, in
a free and open encounter?”52 Eighteenth-century revolutionaries took
Milton’s sentiments to heart and enshrined freedom of the press in the
U.S. Constitution and the French Revolutionary “Declaration of the
Rights of Man.”53 By the middle of the nineteenth century, the idea
that the free and open “contest of ideas” was basic to good government
was dogma. Writing in 1869, John Stuart Mill expressed the hope
that “the time . . . is gone by, when any defense would be necessary
of the ‘liberty of the press’ as one of the securities against corrupt
or tyrannical government.”54 Thus did the press become the “Fourth
Estate,” a bulwark of liberty, in the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century.55
Some, like Oscar Wilde, didn’t believe – or said they didn’t believe –
that the press protected anything.
In old days men had the rack. Now they have the press. That is an improvement certainly. But still it is very bad, and wrong, and demoralizing. Somebody – was it Burke? – called journalism the fourth estate. That was true at
the time no doubt. But at the present moment it is the only estate. It has eaten
up the other three. The Lords Temporal say nothing, the Lords Spiritual have
nothing to say, and the House of Commons has nothing to say and says it.
We are dominated by Journalism.56

But Wilde was in the minority, and a shrinking one at that. The notion
of just what constituted a contribution to the “marketplace of ideas”
expanded mightily in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.57

By the end of the twentieth, all you had to do is say that your writing
was “art” – which naturally makes such a contribution – and it was
protected.58
Privacy

Speaking and listening are usually public. Manuscript-writing and reading are often private. Again, traditional printing falls between these two
stools.
On the send side, recall that a handy medium would make it easy for
senders – in this case, printers – to hide their identities and the content
of their correspondence. Traditional print makes it relatively hard to do
either of these things. Kidnappers use print to hide their identities with
their signature “ransom note” style of cutout print letters. But that’s
not really printing. If you are printing, then you face the following
problem: as the number of copies of a text you print goes up, so does
the difﬁculty of hiding your identity. The reason is purely physical.
Small presses that produce a few copies at a time can be hidden, a fact
that has enabled revolutionaries, radicals, and pornographers to print
their underground wares without too much notice (though probably
too much for them) for the past several centuries. But big presses –
the ones that can produce thousands of feet of print per minute – ﬁll
entire warehouses, require teams of technicians to run, and must be
fed by a long logistical supply train. You can’t hide them. When the
revolution begins, the ﬁrst thing the revolutionaries do is take over
the big newspaper and rename it something like “The People’s Voice.”
They know right where it is, and so will the counter-revolutionaries
when they strike back. That said, if you are willing to use a small press
with limited reproductive capacity, then you can hide your identity.
Now let’s say you want to conceal the contents of what you’ve printed
from those who are not designated recipients. This might seem odd,
given that the usual purpose of printing is precisely to publicize your
message. But nonetheless, there have been times and places in which
hiding printed messages has been deemed necessary. One of them, not
surprisingly, was the Soviet Union. There, “sensitive” printed items –
banned books, magazines and newspapers, internal government reports,
Party memoranda – were kept in special closed collections that restricted
access to those who “needed to know.”59 Copies “for ofﬁcial use only”
121

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

were often numbered to ensure that they all were accounted for, and if
borrowed, would be returned. Of course this still left open the possibility
that “wreckers” would somehow reproduce the item and return the
numbered original, and in fact some people did this. But the Party had
a solution to that problem as well: they simply made sure that copiers –
a dangerous technology in an authoritarian state – remained under
strict government control.60 Copiers are anti-communist. Nevertheless,
hiding the contents of printed texts is hard, and it gets harder the more
copies you print. Most texts aren’t hard to hide, and people like to
pass them around. If they are short enough, they can be memorized
(prisoners in the Gulag did a lot of this) or copied by hand (Soviet
citizens did a lot of this).
On the receive side, recall that a handy medium would allow recipients – in this case, the readers of printed texts – to hide their identities
as well as the contents of the messages they receive. Neither of these
tasks is difﬁcult. To get reading material anonymously, you only need
to follow a few simple rules. First, stay out of bookstores, libraries,
or anyplace where someone might see you get a book you don’t want
people to know you have, say The Anarchist Cookbook or The Devil
Wears Prada. You might go to one of these places to get books you
do want people to know you have just for misdirection’s sake. Proﬁles
in Courage or Tom Sawyer would be excellent choices. Second, when
you must get a book from someone you don’t know, order it by mail
using a phony name and post ofﬁce box. The post ofﬁce knows that
there’s big money in providing this kind of cover for men who want
girly magazines, so they make it dead simple. Third, whenever possible
get your books from people you know well and trust. Make sure they
don’t work for the secret police. If they don’t, chances are they won’t
rat you out. Finally, do all of your reading in private and discuss it with
no one outside your trusted circle. Do no “public readings” and avoid
“book clubs.” If you have questions about any of these rules, seek out a
Russian, Cuban, or basically anyone who has lived in an authoritarian
country. They are well practiced in private reading and will be able to
explain everything to you.
Printing, then, would seem to be semi-public. If you do it, people
will probably notice, though not always. But reading print is, or at least
can be, private. If you are cautious, you won’t ever be observed doing
it. As we saw was the case with the accessibility of print, however, the
122

HOMO LECTOR

privacy of print changed considerably over time in the early modern and
modern West. It began quite public and, as presses became more widely
available and reading more common, became more private. Thus, we
will treat it in its modern form and classify it as relatively private on both
the send and receive sides. According to our theory, private media foster
segmented networks, and segmented networks close social practices and
values. We will presently see that this was the case in the eighteenth-,
nineteenth-, and twentieth-century West.
In the Manuscript Era, the privacy of writing enabled the elite to
accomplish two important things: to privatize political affairs and to
gain control of sacred power. Because they and they alone could write,
the princes and priests of the Manuscript Era could conduct their business (which, as it happened, was everyone’s business) and control the
lingua sacra in private, out of the view of their ordinarily illiterate
subjects. At the beginning of the modern Print Era, the elite continued to enjoy private dominance over political and religious matters due
to their command of printing itself. But over the course of the early
modern period, the princes and priests allowed the print channel to
slip from their grasp. Printers made printing more and more private,
thereby removing it from the gaze of the authorities and creating a relatively safe channel through which subjects could engage their fellows
regarding the res publica and res sacra. Paradoxically, then, the privacy
of printing enabled once muted subjects to break the elite’s monopoly
on political and religious power and to become political and religious
powers themselves. In so doing, they created what we now call the
“public sphere” – the open forum in which affairs common to all are
rationally discussed by all, or at least those with printing presses.61
The press helped open the public sphere, but it also solidiﬁed and
expanded the private sphere. In the Manuscript and early Print Eras,
reading – itself an elite activity – was surprisingly public.62 First, people read out loud. Like musical notation, writing was understood to
be a set of prompts that allowed speech to be “played back.” Second, people read in front of others. Reading was a performance, and
performances were to be conducted before audiences. Finally, readers performed texts of interest to the public, which, being elite, itself
was quite small and uniform. Because the audience was homogeneous,
so were the texts. With the advent of print, however, reading became
much more private, and the very notion of “privacy” was articulated
123

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

in a modern way.63 Unlike manuscript writers and performers, early
modern printers were in the business of producing many texts for a
varied audience made up of readers of all different skill levels. Thus,
the printers needed to make technical accommodations for marginal
readers. Fonts would need to be clear and large. Words and sentences
would need to be separated. Language would need to be simpliﬁed, and
even translated out of little-known idioms (Latin, Greek) and into the
vernacular. Similarly, the printers would have to expand the range of
topics in their catalogues. Religious texts and classics remained at the
top of the “list,” but they were joined by romances, histories, dramas,
adventures, travels, and tall tales of every sort. Finally, printed materials would have to be made affordable, which is to say made badly.
Thus, the leather-covered, board-bound book was joined by various
sorts of “ephemera” – chapbooks, broadsheets, and the like. As the
printers went “down market,” they liberated common people from the
necessity of listening to elites read aloud; the half-literate masses could
just read cheap, legible texts to themselves by themselves, out loud or
silently.
Making the book private allowed printers to exploit a huge and
untapped market – the trade in guilty pleasures. Guilty pleasures, of
course, are things you do for personal enjoyment but don’t feel so
good about and, usually, don’t want others to know you are doing. In
strict, patriarchal, religion-bound societies like early modern England
or France, the demand for guilty pleasures was no doubt high, but the
supply was low precisely because it was difﬁcult to hide the naughty bits
you were pursuing. Books, however, could be hidden and consumed
in private. And so books became ﬁlled with every manner of guilty
pleasure. The archetypal case is the pornographic book, a “published”
artifact that can really only be enjoyed in private.64 The famous English
diarist Samuel Pepys bought The School of Girls for private enjoyment
on February 8, 1688. The next night he “read” it:
We sang till almost night, and drank my good store of wine; and then they
parted, and I to my chamber, where I did read through L’escholle des ﬁlles, a
lewd book, but what doth me no wrong to read for information sake (but it
did hazer my prick para stand all the while, and una vez to decharger); and
after I had done it I burned it, that it might not be among my books to my
shame.65

124

HOMO LECTOR

As we can see, Pepys was conﬂicted about the book. It was fun, but it
was bad. Moralists, politicians, and clergy were generally more consistent, at least in public: pornography was just bad. But as much as they
railed against the reading of naughty books, they could not stop people
from reading them.
That was the “is” of the situation: the privacy of print allowed
people to enter the public sphere and do as they liked in the private
sphere. The “ought” that followed was composed of two parts, one
already familiar to us and the other not. The former is the doctrine
of the “marketplace of ideas.” It served as a justiﬁcation for the right
of private subjects to print in the public sphere. The “marketplace of
ideas” was, however, primarily intended as a defense of the “right” to
print high-minded political and religious texts. But what of the lowminded printed texts that the public so avidly consumed in private?
Some defense of the “right” to read tasteless, offensive, and obscene
texts had to be mounted if the public was to be given what it wanted and
print could provide. That defense took the form of privatism, the notion
that information need not be shared. It manifested itself in several doctrines, all of which are known to and hallowed by right-thinking people
everywhere.
The ﬁrst was the “right to privacy” itself. In public, hierarchy should
be maintained, and thus some should be more equal than others. But
in private, hierarchy was erased, and everyone was equally free to act
as they wished, and more particularly read as they wished. This idea
seems to ﬁnd its origins in the seventeenth-century debate concerning the
right of the state to intervene in “private” confessional matters, though
there is some disagreement on this score.66 In any case, it was certainly
established by the American Revolution, for the Founding Fathers wrote
it into the “establishment clause” of the First Amendment, a doctrine
more commonly known as the “separation of church and state.”67
The notion that you could read anything in the privacy of your own
home came much later and is still debated, but it came nonetheless.68
The second was the “harm principle,” the notion that governments
should not forbid people from doing things that harm no one but the
doers. It ﬁnds its origins in Mill, though he never intended it to cover the
vast and somewhat disturbing range of “victimless” naughtiness that it
came to protect.69 In truth it was rather late in coming, and might well

125

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

be thought of as a product of the Audiovisual Era. But it was ﬁrst tested
on “obscene” literature and therefore rightfully belongs, at least in part,
to the Print Era. Of course, whether things like pornographic literature
are damaging or not is an open question.70 But, judging by what one
ﬁnds in the popular press, there is little public sympathy for the idea
that it is in most Western democracies.71 Some have even gone further
and suggested that pornography, far from being harmful, is beneﬁcial.72
The third doctrine follows from the second. For, if everyone has the
right to read whatever they like in private, you have the obligation
to let them. This is the principle of “obligatory tolerance.” It, too,
was late in coming, though it is also bound to print. In 1953, for
example, the American Library Association and the American Book
Publishers Council endorsed a statement of principles entitled “The
Freedom to Read.” Among the many reasons it gives to guard this
“freedom” generally, one ﬁnds this:
To some, much of modern expression is shocking. But is not much of life itself
shocking? We cut off literature at the source if we prevent writers from dealing
with the stuff of life. Parents and teachers have a responsibility to prepare
the young to meet the diversity of experiences in life to which they will be
exposed, as they have a responsibility to help them learn to think critically
for themselves. These are afﬁrmative responsibilities, not to be discharged
simply by preventing them from reading works for which they are not yet
prepared. In these matters values differ, and values cannot be legislated; nor
can machinery be devised that will suit the demands of one group without
limiting the freedom of others.73

In other words, every citizen has a duty to tolerate any manner of print
expression no matter how “shocking” it might be.
And ﬁnally, we have a fourth doctrine, “aesthetic populism.” This
is the notion that the people should be given what they want, that the
popular is the same as the good, and that public opinion is the arbiter of
taste. It means that no printed text, no matter how distasteful to some,
can be banned on aesthetic grounds. It was also a late arrival. In the ﬁrst
half of the nineteenth century, Tocqueville noticed it among Americans
(and was disgusted).74 In the second half of that century, the English
critic Matthew Arnold found it among his countrymen (and was also
disgusted).75 Today it reigns supreme. Those who argue against it are
routinely denounced as “snobs” and “elitists.”76

Fidelity

Most writing is a sort of picture of speech. Most printing is a sort of
picture of writing. As such, a printed copy of a clean manuscript of War
and Peace should be semantically identical to its handwritten source.
Both the one and the other reduce several kinds of sense data – here
about Russia between 1805 and 1813 – to one encoded visual channel,
that is, written language. Thus, you can no more “see” Natasha and
Pierre in the printed War and Peace than you can in the manuscript. You
can only read about them and imagine “seeing” them. This is to say
that both manuscript-writing and printed texts are ﬁve-to-one codes,
and both consequently are low-ﬁdelity media. But there is an important
difference. It’s not between the manuscript text and the printed copy
of it – these, as we just said, are semantically equivalent – but between
copies of the manuscript text and copies of the printed text. After his
many dalliances with young peasant girls, Tolstoy settled down and got
married to one Soﬁa Andreyevna Behrs. The “conscience of Russia”
was apparently a good husband, but he did ask Sophia to do something a bit above and beyond the call of wifely duty, namely, to copy
the manuscript of War and Peace seven times.77 Though comparing all
seven manuscripts would be laborious (though perhaps not too laborious for a graduate student in comparative literature), it stands to
reason that such an exercise would reveal them all to be different from
one another and from the printed ﬁrst edition. It really could not be otherwise: no mere mortal can exactly copy almost half a million words
without making a few mistakes – not even once, let alone seven times. If,
however, one were to compare all the printed copies of the ﬁrst edition
of War and Peace – a task too troublesome for even a graduate student – one would probably ﬁnd them all to be virtually identical. There
might be differences, but they would be few (and highly collectable).78
This leads us to the following conclusion: a copy of a printed text is
usually an exact picture of the printed text. When used as a means
of reproducing text, writing creates editions, while printing produces
facsimiles. The difference in faithfulness is even greater when it comes
to the reproduction of images. We’ve said that both writing and printing are ﬁve-to-one codes, but that’s true only in the case of written
and printed text. Both writing and printing can be used to produce and
reproduce images, that is, motivated signs like a picture of a daisy. You
127

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

can hand-draw a daisy and make a copy of the drawing. You can make
an engraving of a daisy and then print a copy of it. When used in this
mode, writing and printing are four-to-one codes: they reduce sound,
smell, taste, and feeling to vision, while the visual channel itself is not
encoded (or at least as encoded). A drawing or engraving of a daisy is an
icon of a daisy – it doesn’t need to be “read,” only recognized. Though
formally similar, the potential of each medium to reproduce these icons
is vastly different. In order to make one mediocre reproduction of the
Mona Lisa by hand, you need to have talent and a lot of time. But in
order to make thousands of mediocre reproductions of the Mona Lisa
with a press, all you need is one mediocre etching of the Mona Lisa.
Once you have the ability to take photographs and print those, then
you can produce thousands of good copies of the Mona Lisa. And once
you can do this, printing moves from low ﬁdelity to high, at least in the
visual channel.
As concerns text, print is low ﬁdelity: what comes out (inked symbols)
doesn’t look, sound, smell, taste, or feel like what goes in (sense data).
As concerns images, print has somewhat higher ﬁdelity: what comes out
(inked icons) looks more or less like what comes in (sights). Given these
attributes, print networks will be primarily symbolic and secondarily
iconic. Like writing, print’s forte is – or at least was until relatively
recently – the reproduction of text. Print is superior to writing in terms of
its ability to reproduce images. We would expect, then, that the principal
impact of a print network, or rather the dominant symbolic aspect of
it, would be the conceptualization of social practices. Print provides
more symbolic material to more people than any medium before it, and
therefore prompts more abstract representation and systematization
than any medium before it. We would also anticipate, though, that the
iconic aspect of the print network would sensualize social practices. The
reason is this: if humans are given the opportunity to use a medium for
sensual gratiﬁcation at low cost, then they usually will; the ability of
print to reproduce images offers them this chance, though in a limited
way.
We see both conceptualization and sensualization of social practices
in the Print Cultures of early modern and modern Europe. As to the
former, the clearest example is the systematization of organizations of
all kinds. In a Manuscript Culture, most organizations had a sort of
accidental character. They grew and evolved in accordance with the
128

HOMO LECTOR

peculiarities of time, place, and personality. There was rarely if ever
an overarching plan; rather, there were only adjustments from moment
to moment. Take medieval European feudalism.79 Its exact origins are
obscure, though it seems to have evolved circa 1000 out of a kind
of semi-customary compact between the powerful (princes) and the
less powerful (vassals) by which both would rule and tax the powerless (townsmen and peasants). Feudalism was less an imposed system
than an emergent phenomenon, the almost spontaneous appearance of
rough order out of even rougher disorder. Everywhere it went it was
adapted to local conditions on an ad hoc basis. Like a tree, it grew
where it could, withered where it couldn’t, and thereby took on a kind
of gnarly, twisted, organic form. It’s interesting to note that the people
who lived under feudalism had no name for the “system” itself: the
word “feudal” was invented by French lawyers in the sixteenth century, just as the thing itself was breathing its last.80 In the centuries
that followed, feudalism was ﬁnally killed in Europe by rationalizing
bureaucrats, that is, people who liked to plan and organize things and
used print to do it.81 They saw it as their mission to take the gnarled
tree and make of it neatly stacked wooden planks. Their new science of
administration went under various names in different ages: cameralism,
merchantilism, economics, political science, and sociology.82 Its theorists are well known: Colbert, Montesquieu, Justi, Smith, Condorcet,
Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, Compte, Marx, Spencer, Durkheim, and
Weber. For these men and those who thought like them, print – all right
angles, straight lines, and clear logic – was a model for the way human
affairs should be organized. But print was also a means to bring society
into order. Their printed books, each like every other, would teach men
and women the ways of rational, systematic organization. The abstract
plan would thereby become concrete reality. When applied with subtlety, systematization worked. Governments, businesses, and churches
were, as Weber put it, “rationalized” over the course of the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, at least in Northwestern Europe
and North America.83 But when applied with brute force, systematization failed dramatically. There can be no clearer case of this than that
of the Soviet Union. All the Bolsheviks had when they took power was
an abstraction, for no communist society had ever existed.84 When they
proceeded to impose their untried plan on the all-too-organic Russian
empire, the results were disastrous. Yet – and this is the remarkable
129

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

part – the print-aided dream of universal rationalization through social
engineering did not die. It was tried in China, Vietnam, North Korea,
Cuba and elsewhere, again with ruinous consequences.85
That was the “is” of the situation: people – and especially intellectuals – were going to use print to create and disseminate abstract models
of virtually everything on earth and in the heavens. The “ought” that
followed was a modern form of idealism that generally goes under the
name “rationalism.” It held that the rational systematization of ideas
was the best means to the good life. This incredibly inﬂuential doctrine
ﬁnds its modern origins in the Enlightenment.86 For the philosophes
and those who followed them, the application of reason to reality –
what we might simply call “science” – was the basic motor of human
progress. To apply reason to reality was to systematize. In the famed
Discours préliminaire to the Encyclopédie, d’Alembert says as much in
his praise of the “systemic spirit.”87 Indeed, it probably would not be
too much to say that all of post-Enlightenment science has been one
long effort to reduce the observed world to systems, interlocking sets
of propositions that explain what goes on around us. Almost no one
today seriously doubts that this effort has been beneﬁcial to mankind
and should be further pursued, not even most mainstream religious
authorities.88
The ability of print to reproduce images sensualized social practices
from the beginning. The earliest printed items contained images. They
were almost always highly representational – the things depicted could
be immediately recognized, if not really understood, by anyone. This
style was taken up both because many viewers would be poorly educated
and because realistic depictions were simply more sensually powerful
than abstract ones. Early printers realized that not all images were
equally popular. It seemed that the more transgressive the picture, the
more people enjoyed it (and the more the authorities paid attention
to it). Viewers wanted to see things that they could not or did not
want to experience. Thus, many of the printed images – particularly
those aimed at popular readerships – were violent, sexual, or both. For
example, a German pamphlet of 1561 reporting atrocities committed
by Russian troops in Livonia includes a woodcut of the soldiers nailing
the “tender little hearts” of slaughtered children to trees and shooting
arrows at the “privy parts” of freshly ravished virgins.89 There is no
doubt that such images were meant to stimulate feelings, not thoughts,
130

HOMO LECTOR

and no doubt that they succeeded. Naturally, the most reliably and
pleasurably stimulating images were, then as now, pornographic. As
anyone who has ever studied Greek vases or Roman murals knows, the
Ancients demanded pictorial porn and got it, though not much of it.90
Medieval Europeans may have demanded it as well (though, lust being
a sin, they hide it away in their hearts), but they had no ready supply
of it.91 Early modern engravers and printers were happy to enter the
market and fulﬁll their desire, so to speak. Though they were constantly
under the gun of prudish secular and clerical authorities, pornographers
managed to publish a reasonably large catalogue of dirty texts with
many dirty pictures, including most famously The Sixteen Pleasures
(1524), The School of Girls (1655), Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure
(1766), and, inevitably, de Sade’s Justine or The Misfortunes of Virtue
(1791) and Juliette or the Fortunes of Vice (1797). With the invention of
photography in the 1830s, the history of pornographic images entered a
new phase. For, although etchings could be realistic, particularly in the
hands of skilled craftsmen, they were not as realistic as photographs.
In a photograph, the viewer had the impression of seeing things as they
are, and that really matters with pornography. Not surprisingly, the
female nude became a popular subject among photographic “artists.”
In the 1840s, William Fox Talbot ﬁgured out a way to make copies of
photos at a reasonable cost and the industry of photo-porn was born.92
Artsy “postcards” were an early vehicle and millions were produced in
the second half of the nineteenth century.93 Modern printed photo-porn
emerged with the invention of halftone reproduction in the 1880s.94 By
the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century, one could buy magazines full
of nude photographs catering to the interests of artists, nudists, and
health nuts.95 Whether any artists, nudists, or health nuts bought them
is another matter. What followed was a short process in which cultural
inhibitions went down, photographic quality went up, and everything
came off. The tale can be told in titles: Esquire (1933), Playboy (1953),
Penthouse (1965), and Hustler (1974).96
That was the “is” of the situation: people were going to look at all
manner of tasteless printed pictures no matter what. Not people like
you, of course. The “ought” that followed was a collection of ideas
generally called “Romanticism.” Romanticism is a very messy concept;
there are many different Romanticisms.97 But all of them share the
notion that the senses, not the intellect, are the key to living the good
131

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

life. You could not think your way to the Truth, as Plato taught; you
needed to feel your way to it, as Hugh Heffner taught. According to
Nietzsche, Romanticism put “the cult of feeling . . . in place of the cult
of reason.”98 Understandably, it has been associated with the CounterEnlightenment’s attack on overreaching rationalism.99 The Romantics
wanted to feel, and anything that allowed them to do so – be it passionate poetry, erotic images, or hard drugs – was just ﬁne with them.100
Romanticism was perhaps the most inﬂuential ideology of the nineteenth century. Our culture is drenched in it, so much so that Romantic
production and sensibilities have essentially become synonymous with
culture. Poetry, erotic images, and hard drugs don’t really give us that
“oceanic feeling” anymore, though. We prefer new-age music, sex toys,
and espresso machines.101
Volume

The length of the manuscript of War and Peace, a very long written
message, is 460,000 words. The length of the printed version is the
same. The length of a manuscript of Hemingway’s “For Sale,” a very
short written message, is six words. The length of the printed version is
the same. The fact of printing doesn’t enable people to write any more
or any less than they could in the Manuscript Era. Hands still get tired;
eyes still get sore. Yet print has a much higher carrying capacity than
manuscript-writing for one simple reason: it’s better at making copies.
Imagine you have a 1,200-word composition. If you copied 25 words
a minute (a reasonable pace) for 48 minutes out of every hour (you
need to rest), you could produce 10 copies a day. If you were an early
modern printer, you could produce 500 copies in the same time. If you
were using a modern web-fed printing press, the kind they use to print
newspapers, then you could produce something on the order of 14.5
billion copies in a 10-hour day.102 That’s more than two copies for
each person on earth. The print “pipe,” as they say, is wide indeed. Just
how wide is not known for the world as a whole, but good statistics
are available for the United States. There are something on the order
of 80,000 book publishers in the United States. They issued 276,000
new titles in 2007; 411,422 if nontraditional “print-on-demand” publishers are included.103 In 2006, 3.1 billion books were sold in the
United States.104 In the same year, there were 1,452 daily newspapers in
132

HOMO LECTOR

the United States with weekday circulations averaging around 35,000;
about 53 million Americans buy newspapers every day.105 In 2007,
there were over 19,000 magazines (titles) printed in the United States
and Canada.106 Americans buy almost 370 million magazines a year
(comic books not included).107
Print is indeed a high-volume medium. Though the messages you can
produce with it are not typically any longer or shorter than those you
can write, you can produce a lot more copies of them. High-volume
media engender unconstrained networks, that is, networks in which
there is transmission and storage capacity to spare. This is certainly
true of printing: on a cost-per-unit basis, printing is inexpensive. In our
world, print is so cheap that we often give it away and, after we’ve
used it, throw it away. According to our theory, unconstrained networks will hedonize social practices developed in and around them.
Here “hedonize” means to use for the sake of entertainment or enjoyment. The reason unconstrained networks hedonize social practices is
this: if humans can use a medium for diversion at low cost, then they
will; print drives down the cost of such use dramatically.
The hedonizing impact of print in early modern European culture is
everywhere apparent. In medieval Europe, as in any Manuscript Culture, texts were expensive. This meant that most of the bandwidth of
writing was “owned,” so to say, by the elite and used for high-value documentation – legal papers, administrative materials, ceremonial texts,
and, above all, scripture. Of course, there was “literature,” that is, writing meant to be read for pleasure. But there was comparatively little of
it, both in terms of the number of titles and number of copies of those
titles. You might not get this impression when taking a class on the
ancient literary tradition of this or that culture, for they sometimes
give the impression that “literature” then was something like “literature” now. It wasn’t. Even texts that are today considered classics were
extraordinarily rare in most Manuscript Cultures. Beowulf, for example, comes down to us in a single manuscript copied circa 1000.108 If it
was popular in its time, we would expect to ﬁnd many more copies of
it. Yet we don’t. The reason is clear: few could read, those who could
weren’t interested, and those who were interested probably didn’t have
the money to subsidize the creation of a manuscript copy. All that
changed with the coming of print. Many more people could read, many
more people were interested, and print’s remarkable fecundity drove
133

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

the cost of catering to those interests further and further down. Print
had the bandwidth required to accommodate both the serious stuff –
like law and theology – and a whole host of new types of fun-to-read
writing: myths, tales, stories, poems, ballads, songs, tragedies, histories, biographies, comedies, farces, romances, news, satires, parodies,
encomia, jeremiads, blasts, counterblasts, allegories, plays, adventures,
mysteries, horrors, thrillers, fantasies, and pornography in abundance.
The ﬁrst professional writer was born in this era (probably John Dryden,
the seventeenth-century English wordsmith),109 as was the passionate reader (and I do not use the word “passionate” loosely). Proﬁtminded printers were only too happy to put the two of them together.
The “authorities” might not like it, but as we’ve seen, the logistics
of print production and consumption made censorship an expensive
proposition.
That was the “is” of the situation: people were going to use the wide
bandwidth supplied by print for the purposes of entertainment, and
there was little anyone could do about it. The “ought” that followed
was a modern hedonism captured by the notion of “self-improvement”
and particularly self-improvement through reading. It holds that the act
of reading itself, almost no matter what you read, is a means of bettering yourself. Plato thought that reading was a waste of time, but by
the nineteenth century, most educational reformers, like, say, Horace
Mann, thought it was quite the opposite. Teaching people to read, literacy advocates claimed, made them, ipso facto, better people. Mann
argued that reading itself made them more productive.110 One might
well think that “this message was brought to you” by the very people who sell you printed matter, as they had the most to gain by your
believing that reading and virtue were identical. But, historically speaking, that’s not so: the progressive state propagated the “cult of reading”
because progressive administrators really believed that reading was a
kind of ennobling patriotic act. “Literacy is the path to communism,”
read an early Soviet poster.111 It wasn’t, but it was the path to more
reading. Naturally, neither educators nor administrators thought that
all literature was equally salutary: some of it was so unwholesome as to
be banned. But the general drift of opinion tended toward the notion
that reading in and of itself was “good” no matter what you read. That
includes trashy novels, dirty stories, and really bad poetry. That’s not
only because all reading makes you “more literate,” but also because
134

HOMO LECTOR

reading will improve your health, mental and otherwise, or so some
psychologists claim.112 Thus was a vice – idle pleasure-seeking or even
sloth – transformed into a virtue. Interestingly, no one has ever seriously
argued that “all television watching is good.”
Velocity

The velocity of a medium is primarily determined by the speed with
which messages can be created and transmitted. Speech is fast. You just
think of something to say, say it, and your words travel at the speed of
sound to your interlocutor (if, of course, your interlocutor is in earshot).
In contrast, writing is slow. Once you think of something, you have to
write it down and then carry it, or have it carried, to the recipient. For
most of its history, printing has been even slower than writing. Print
didn’t change the amount of time it took to conceive of something brilliant to say, but it made almost everything that followed take longer
than it had before. You can write eight pages in a couple of hours. It
took early modern printers approximately 10 hours to set eight pages
of type and another 10 hours to print the ﬁrst copy made from it. Then
the printed text had to be physically moved to the reader. From the ﬁfteenth through eighteenth centuries, this meant carrying the documents
by foot, transporting them by horse, or sending them by boat. All of
these means of transport are sluggish, especially on routes overrun with
bandits, traversed by bad roads, or plagued by rough seas – that is,
most places. Beginning in the nineteenth century, industrious printers
developed new technologies – linotypes, powered presses – with which
they could set type and print copy faster. These industrial-age printers
were also able to move printed text more rapidly thanks to new vehicles – trains, motor-driven ships, trucks, and airplanes – and more safely
thanks to secure routes. Even with these improvements, though, the
rate of production and transmission remained (and remains) leisurely
by electronic standards. Eventually the post ofﬁce helped quicken the
pace of delivery. Postal systems are ancient, but good postal systems,
the kind that reliably transmit text anywhere at a reasonable speed for
a reasonable price, are a product of the nineteenth century. It’s rather
shocking to recall that the humble postage stamp was not invented
until about 1840 and took the better part of a century to spread over
the globe.113 From the perspective of printers and their customers,
135

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

however, a good postal system itself doesn’t entirely do the trick,
because being able to send something by post and being able to afford
to send it that way are two different things. Although newspapers, magazines, and books are reasonably light compared to, say, stone tablets,
they are heavy compared to paper letters. Thus, they cost more than
letters to transport. For decades after the organization of the modern postal services, the cost of transmitting printed wares priced most
would-be readers out of the market. It was only with the introduction
of special print rates in the later nineteenth century that it became economical to send and receive bulky printed matter. You have government
subsidies to thank for the fact that you receive newspapers, magazines,
and books by “snail mail.”
Print, then, is a low-velocity medium. Low-velocity media give rise
to monologic networks, which is to say that trafﬁc over them tends to
move in one direction. The senders send and the recipients receive. These
roles are difﬁcult to reverse due to the time and effort it takes to reply,
especially in medium-kind. You might just be moved to write an angry
letter to the dunderheaded editors of The Pretty New Republic, but you
certainly are not going to buy a printing press, learn to use it, and print a
response. The folks on the masthead of the TPNR talk to you; you really
don’t get to talk back to them. The editors of The Really New Republic,
who disagree with everything they read in The Pretty New Republic,
might well print a response in their pages, thereby creating a kind of
“dialogue” with their mortal enemies. If there are enough magazines like
the TPNR and TRNR, something like a “discussion” might take place
among their editors. But calling this sort of back-and-forth a “dialogue”
or “discussion” rather strains the terms. By the time you get TRNR’s
counterblast to TPNR’s blast, you may well have forgotten what all
the fuss was about. By our theory, monologic networks monocratize
social practices evolved in and around them. This is to say they blunt
the natural impulse of humans to exchange information rapidly and, in
its place, impose a unidirectional structure on communications.
Print did not alter the basically monologic pattern established by
written networks in medieval Europe, but it did lead to the creation of
many more such networks. The medieval elite – princes and priests –
was reasonably successful in monopolizing written communications.
They “spoke” through writing to the largely illiterate masses, who in
turn were compelled by their illiteracy and lack of power to “listen.”
136

HOMO LECTOR

To put this point in structural terms, a few nodes communicated with
many nodes that could not themselves respond. As we’ve seen, however,
early modern European elites were not completely successful in controlling the printing press: they could guide it, but not really monopolize
it. Throughout the early modern period, powerful princely and priestly
interests remained the loudest voices in the land. Their print-based
monologic networks were larger and more persuasive than any others.
But there were others, and as time went on, there were more and more
of them. Beginning in the Reformation, opponents of this or that began
to use the press to issue messages that were in one way or another
critical of the status quo. In so doing, they created a large number
of unofﬁcial, interconnected monologic networks, a “public sphere.”
These networks were ordinarily evanescent. One thinks, for example,
of the many pamphleteers who rapidly entered and exited the political
scene during the English Civil War, the American Revolution, or the
French Revolution. Others, however, proved to be lasting, ﬁrst among
them newspapers. By the eighteenth century, newspapers had become
institutions in their own right. Democratic politicians, who often wrote
for them and published them, saw newspapers as fortresses of freedom
and sought constitutional protection for them. They were right to do
so, for the press played a crucial role in the creation of limited, representative government. Yet we need to remember that print networks, for
all they aided the democratic cause, were (and are) themselves monologic. This is most obvious where tyrants destroy the free press and
replace it with party papers, as in the case of the Soviet Union or Cuba.
The Workers’ Voice usually isn’t. But even in democratic states, media
moguls, corporations, and ofﬁcials manipulate the press for their own
purposes. They are able to do so precisely because of the monologic
structure of print networks: they “speak” and we “listen.”
That was the “is” of the situation: it was difﬁcult to have any sort
of meaningful exchange by means of print, thus those with presses
“talked” and those without “listened.” This reality was a tricky thing
to accommodate in the relatively liberal political cultures of eighteenthand nineteenth-century Western Europe. For, if “the people” were
sovereign, as democratic theory held, why didn’t all the people get
to “speak”? This paradox was accommodated by means of a kind of
dictatorism, that is, the notion that some should speak for others. It
came in two variants. In its mild version, it simply stated that those
137

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

with presses were somehow the victors in the “marketplace of ideas.”
They had better ideas, so they were entitled to “speak.” If you thought
differently, you were free to write a letter to the editor or even buy a
press and enter the marketplace yourself. Of course this is ludicrous,
but it served the purposes of those with presses, who were powerful,
and was consistent with the idea that the press should be private, which
remained sacrosanct in liberal governments. In its harsh version, invariably found in authoritarian and socialist regimes, the idea of freedom of
the press was said to be a plot to oppress “the people.” Listen to Lenin:
“The capitalists have always used the term ‘freedom’ to mean freedom
for the rich to get richer and for the workers to starve to death. And in
capitalist usage, freedom of the press means freedom of the rich to bribe
the press, freedom to use their wealth to shape and fabricate so-called
public opinion.”114 Lenin knew just what to do about the capitalists’
abuse of the press: “The ﬁrst thing to do to win real equality and genuine democracy for the working people, for the workers and peasants,
is to deprive capital of the possibility of hiring writers, buying publishing houses and bribing newspapers. And to do that the capitalists and
exploiters have to be overthrown and their resistance oppressed.”115 In
Lenin’s mind, the Vanguard Party should control the press because it
knew what “the people” wanted and could “speak” for them. If you
disagreed with what the Party said, you could complain to the local
Party cell or even begin your own underground press, but you would
probably be well advised not to do so.
Range

Many people feel guilty that they don’t know enough about what’s
going on abroad. They should, for a mass of accessible information
from abroad is available at many corner newsstands. If you’ve got a
good one in your town – and most of us do – you’ll ﬁnd newspapers
and magazines from all over the world: London, Cairo, Moscow, Delhi,
Beijing, Tokyo, Sydney, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, New York and on and
on. And even if you haven’t got a ﬁrst-rate foreign news-seller in your
town, you can probably easily ﬁnd out how to order newspapers from
abroad and have them delivered right to your door. You’ve got no
excuse. After a bit of reading you will have a diplomat’s knowledge of

138

HOMO LECTOR

global affairs. Or you’ll just scratch the entire self-improving project
and remain in the dark with the rest of us. In any case, it’s clear that
we owe the ability to bone up on what’s going on in the world to print.
This may seem surprising, because in terms of range, print is no better
or worse than manuscript-writing. Both have the two properties that
are necessary to give any physical medium long range. First, stability:
information carried by writing or print does not decay if the substrate on
which it is inscribed is of reasonable quality. Second, transportability:
manuscripts and books are neither bulky nor terribly heavy, meaning
you can move them easily. Thus, there is no practical limit to the range a
manuscript or printed page can travel if it is made of the right stuff and
carried by the right vehicle. Although the ranges of manuscripts and
print are the same, their reach is very different. Because writing is a
point-to-point medium, our ability to use it to send messages to many
people simultaneously is constrained, as we said, by the expense of
reproduction and transmission. Manuscripts usually cannot be copied
inexpensively, so they are not a suitable means of mass distribution. In
stark contrast, printed copy can be reproduced cheaply, so it is easy to
use for the purposes of mass distribution. You won’t be the only one
reading The Times of India outside India. Thousands of others will as
well, due precisely to the reproductive power of print.
Print, then, is a long-range medium with signiﬁcant reach: you can
send it across the globe and, if you are Rupert Murdoch, to millions of
people. Media with these characteristics generate extensive networks,
which is to say networks that enable senders to distribute messages
widely in both the geographic and demographic sense. Murdoch has
an extensive print network indeed. According to our theory, extensive
networks should diversify social practices and values, meaning they will
become more varied, especially in the ethnic sense. Extensive networks
bring strangers in contact with one another at a greater rate than intensive networks. Moreover, they often compel or encourage strangers to
cooperate with one another. This sort of familiarity breeds understanding and thereby fosters an expanded, diverse world picture.
Diversiﬁcation was one of the hallmarks of early modern European
history. In the mid-ﬁfteenth century, when print was born, Europe was
an astoundingly parochial place. The vast majority of common people
were illiterate peasants who were born, lived, and died “with their

139

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

own.” They traveled little and knew less about what was going on even
a short distance from their places of birth. They rarely met strangers,
and when they did, were profoundly suspicious of them. Naturally there
were exceptions. The elites – capitalists, princes, and pastors – knew
more of the wider world, and perhaps had seen some of it. But even
among them the degree of provincialism was, by modern standards,
astounding. Most people are aware that Europeans did not know the
Americas existed prior to Columbus’s famed journey of 1492. But fewer
people know that they, or at least those who live west of the Elbe
River, did not know Russia existed before approximately that date.
As far as the Spanish, English, French, and even German elites were
concerned, what lay beyond Poland was terra incognita every bit as
much as the territory beyond the great ocean to their west. That’s
why, once they “discovered” Russia in the sixteenth century, they put
accounts of it right next to descriptions of America in books with titles
like Novus Orbis, the “New World.”116 It isn’t the relative isolation
of the sixteenth-century Europeans that should draw our attention,
for that was a common characteristic of all Manuscript Cultures all
over the globe. Rather, it is the very existence of printed books like
Novus Orbis and the social practices they reﬂected. Europeans were
on the move – exploring, conquering, and colonizing. And as they
did so, they brought back news, which they disseminated with the aid
of print. Thousands of ethnographic reports about parts foreign were
printed in the early modern period, hundreds about Russia alone.117
As they were printed, scattered, and read, the European demographic
picture expanded mightily. What had been a small, homogenous world
made up of families and neighbors, parishes and counties, became an
enormous, diverse world comprising tribes and peoples, kingdoms and
empires.
Print not only diversiﬁed the extra-European world, but the innerEuropean world as well. Capitalists needed information about European markets, rulers needed information about their allies and competitors, and pastors needed information about European souls that
might be saved. The press provided it all, and no vehicle was more
effective than the print newspaper.118 From its beginnings as the oneoff “relation” in the sixteenth century, the newspaper grew rapidly into
a mighty organ of information dissemination. It was a kind of “difference engine” in that its stock and trade were differences. Where things
140

HOMO LECTOR

were the same, there was nothing to report. But where they were different, there was a story. It made little difference how far away the story
was, for the agents of print could get to it (and, more importantly, get
back). Neither did it make much difference whether 100 or 100,000
people wanted the story, for print could reproduce and, as the means
of transportation improved, disseminate it to those who could read and
afford it. And, as literacy spread and the price of print dropped, the
number of people who could do the one and the other ballooned.
That was the “is” of the situation: print made the world a much
more varied, information-rich place. The “ought” that followed was,
predictably, a modern form of pluralism that is nicely captured by
the doctrine of “toleration.” It held that there were no “strangers” in
the sense of unclassiﬁable people or things to be assiduously avoided.
Everyone and everything was of one type (known), but could be subcategorized as “us” or “them,” the “thems” being further subcategorized
as “them A,” “them B,” “them C,” ad inﬁnitum. The doctrine’s origins can be traced to the debate over religious toleration in sixteenthand seventeenth-century Europe, the conclusion of which was the general sentiment, backed up by law, that religious toleration was a good
thing.119 Thereafter it began to assume its modern form as a kind of
“one-world-ism” in which differences of all kinds would be respected.
The kernel of this idea can be seen in Kant’s proposed community of
nations in his Perpetual Peace (1795),120 though it did not ﬁnd mature
expression until the League of Nations (1920) and the United Nations
(1945). The UN’s “Universal Declaration of Human Rights” (1948)
is a particularly forceful statement of universal toleration. Article two
states:
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration,
without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion,
political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other
status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political,
jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a
person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under
any other limitation of sovereignty.121

In other words, “We are the World.” But not only “us.” This also
means everything on the world and the world itself. Just ask member
of the animal rights movement or the environmental movement.

Persistence

In the last chapter, we took a trip to the British Museum to look at
a 2,600-year-old tablet upon which part of The Epic of Gilgamesh
was inscribed, and we noted that, despite its considerable antiquity,
the text was still legible. That’s the case because the stuff upon which
it is written – clay – is very sturdy, the script in which it is written –
cuneiform – has been deciphered, and the language encoded in the
script – Akkadian – is known today. The persistence of any written
document is determined by these same three factors: substrate, script,
and language. By and large, print is persistent. If you’ve ever had the
opportunity to handle early printed books, then you will know that
they were printed on tough stuff – mashed, bleached, cotton rags.122
Think of a pressed, starched, white dress shirt and you’ll get the idea.
Indeed, except for a bit of yellowing and the occasional worm hole,
even ﬁfteenth-century books still look pretty good. In the nineteenth
century, printers began to use new kinds of low-cost, ﬂimsy “pulp”
paper.123 Such stuff is still used for newspapers today. But most good
publishers now use archival quality, acid-free paper that is meant to
last hundreds of years. The scripts used in printed books are also stable.
Though the world has thousands of languages, it only has hundreds
of writing systems. And though there are hundreds of writing systems,
only a fraction of them have been printed. In fact, most of the world’s
printing is and has always been done in scripts based on a few character
sets: Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Indic, Chinese foremost among them. Since
millions – and in some cases billions – of people use these scripts on
a daily basis, they aren’t going to disappear any time soon. The same
might be said of the languages they are used to encode: only a few of
the world’s many languages are printed with any regularity, and they
tend to be the ones spoken by millions of people. They aren’t going
to go away, either. As a result of the stability of modern scripts and
languages, one would be hard pressed today to ﬁnd even a single printed
document that couldn’t be sounded out or understood by someone. Yet
the persistence of print is even greater than that of manuscript-writing
for another reason. The British Museum’s ancient tablet inscribed with
part of The Epic of Gilgamesh is unique or close to it. If this chunk
of clay is destroyed – heaven forbid – then it will be lost forever. The

142

HOMO LECTOR

Epic of Gilgamesh, however, will not be lost. Thanks to print, the text
itself exists in thousands of copies in dozens of scripts in hundreds of
languages scattered all over the globe. It would take a catastrophe of
biblical proportions – a bit like the ﬂood described in the text itself –
for all of these copies, scripts, and speakers to be lost.124
In short, print is a persistent medium. It’s true that paper, the primary substrate used in printing, is not as robust as stone. Paper burns,
rots, and fades. But it makes up for this disadvantage by incredible
redundancy. Printed items are almost never unique. Persistent media
give rise to additive networks. These are webs of connected nodes in
which information accumulates as it is created and transmitted. If you
recite The Epic of Gilgamesh from memory, and then recite it again,
you still only have one copy. Since it’s stored in your head, it will perish when you do if you fail to pass it on orally. If you print The Epic
of Gilgamesh, and then print it again, you have two copies. Since the
text has been recorded in a stable medium, it will survive your passing,
and probably the passing of several generations after you. According to
our theory, additive networks historicize social practices evolved in and
around them. People in additive networks are constantly confronted
with the human past, and especially the past as recorded in writing.
Because of this fact, their time horizons begin to recede and the past,
present, and future become clearly separate, alterable entities.
Early modern Europe was historicized to a degree never before witnessed in world history, and the reason has everything to do with
print and the additive networks it engendered. In Manuscript Cultures,
manuscripts accumulated, but not very quickly because so few of them
were created and they were so difﬁcult to copy. Thus, manuscript messages from the past to the present were comparatively few. In Print Cultures, printed texts accumulated rapidly because so many of them could
be inexpensively produced and reproduced. Take books, for example.
The number of titles printed annually in England increased from several
hundred in the early 1500s to several thousand circa 1800.125 It was
really only at that point, however, with the introduction of machinepowered presses, cheap paper, and the rapid increase in literacy that
print production took off.126 In the United States, for example, over
6,000 titles were being published annually by 1900;127 today 275,000
are produced annually.128 The number of books accumulated at an

143

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

incredible pace. It seems sensible to say that between one million and
two million books were produced annually in the sixteenth century.129
Something on the order of a billion were printed in the United States
in 2007.130 All of these books accumulate. WorldCat, a union catalogue including the holdings of about 70,000 libraries, contains about
110 million records (titles) and references 1.3 billion items (books, journals, etc.).131 According to the American Library Association, America’s
100 largest libraries collectively house 526 million volumes.132 If you
walk into one of these great textual repositories – or any other great
print archive, for that matter – you are in a sense walking back in time.
You are surrounded by artifacts from the past that “speak” to you in
the voice of the past. It’s hardly surprising that the historical profession
as such emerged with print, for only print could supply the historical
material and means of scholarly communication necessary to sustain it
in its modern form.
But it wasn’t only history that emerged as a result of print – it
was modern scientiﬁc practice in general. We noted earlier that writing enabled people to rearrange signs in space, ﬁx them indeﬁnitely,
replay them, and then amend them in accordance with new observations. This, we said, was the essence of scientiﬁc practice. Yet it was
not enough to engender scientiﬁc practices of the kind we know today –
professional training and standards, scholarly societies and journals,
research-oriented facilities like labs and libraries. These came into being
only after print made it possible to accurately reproduce and disseminate
theories to increasingly large numbers of proto-scientists for “testing.”
Manuscript Cultures had few “scholarly communities” in the sense of
coherent, intergenerational groups of widely scattered experts working
on the same material; those they had were almost uniformly focused
on religious questions. Manuscripts were too few and their contents
too variable for such communities to emerge and sustain themselves. In
the world of print, however, scholarly communities could form around
key printed texts, each identical to the next, that focused the attention
of readers on common problems. A crucial development here was the
creation of the scientiﬁc society and its journal in the seventeenth century. The former gave scientists a home and the latter offered them a
common script – a “literature” – to keep up with, test, and amend. The
journals in particular established a clear chain of evidence that led from

144

HOMO LECTOR

past beliefs to present, from good to better, from wrong to right, from
imperfection to perfection. In their pages the very notion of scientiﬁc
progress appeared. Indeed, anyone who read past issues of the Transactions of this or that scholarly society would know this to be the case:
new theories replaced old ones that were then replaced by still newer
ones. And so the cycle of improvement proceeded.
That was the “is” of the situation: print promoted the pursuit of
history and science. The “ought” that followed was a sort of temporalism centered on the idea of progress. The Manuscript Era knew
both the notion of linear time and the idea of progress, though neither
was the dominant conception of the age despite what some historians
have written.133 The Ancients were besotted with the notions of the
(lapsed) Golden Age and the Eternal Recurrence.134 Some authors ﬁnd
the origins of the idea of progress in early Christian eschatology, but
this is a difﬁcult case to make as Christian time has a beginning and
end and so must Christian progress.135 “Our” progress, however, may
have a beginning but it has no end, just like “our” time itself. To ﬁnd
a widespread, fully articulated understanding of open-ended progress,
one must look to the Print Era, just as J. B. Bury said in his classic
treatment of the idea.136 Renaissance scholars nibbled at open-ended
progress, and the philosophes – especially Turgot and Condorcet –
made of it a tasty side dish. But it wasn’t until the nineteenth century
that it became the main course, so to speak. For Saint-Simon, Comte,
Hegel, Marx, Spencer, and the rest of the “big thinkers” of the age,
the idea that history was one more or less inevitable upward swing
was dogma.137 The “motors” that these gentlemen identiﬁed as “driving” history cum progress varied: sometimes they were ideas, sometimes
classes, and sometimes technologies. But the notion of limitless advance
was shared by all and became common coin in the Victorian era.138
As we saw earlier, Cicero proclaimed “Historia magister vitae est.”139
It was a suitable pronouncement for the Manuscript Era, but was outmoded in the Print Era. George Santayana seems to have realized this
when he wrote, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned
to repeat it.”140 The telling word here is “repeat,” for repetition of past
mistakes is exactly what the study of the past and present was intended
to avoid. And if you don’t repeat past mistakes, then how can you not
progress?

Searchability

After you’re done reading the ancient though remarkably well-preserved
ﬂood story in Room 55 at the British Museum, pop by the British
Library. It’s not far, you can walk. Go to the circulation desk and ask if
you can get in the stacks. The rules say you can’t, so they probably won’t
let you. But let’s say the librarians allow you in. Now look for, say, War
and Peace. They have it, which is good. But they also have around 13
million other books, which is bad. Happily, the tireless bibliographers
at the British Library have carefully catalogued every volume in their
vast collection. They know where every book is, or at least should be,
and have recorded the address in an electronic database that you can
search. But let’s say you decide, just for fun, to look for War and Peace
without reference to this remarkable ﬁnding-aid, or any ﬁnding-aid for
that matter. If the books are randomly distributed (and let’s just say they
are), then the chances the ﬁrst book you look at will be War and Peace
are one in 13 million. As you look, you will eliminate books, so your
chances get better: the chances the next book is War and Peace are one
in 12,999,999, the book after that are one in 12,999,998, and so on. If
you look at one book a second without interruption, then the amount
of time it will take you to ﬁnd War and Peace will fall between one
second (very lucky) and 150 days, 11 hours, 6 minutes, and 40 seconds
(very unlucky). You better use the electronic catalogue.
No less than manuscript text, printed text is difﬁcult to search for a
number of reasons. You have to have access to it. If the librarians say
“no,” your search is over. Text must be searched serially. Even the best
physical ﬁnding aids won’t get you very “deep” into the text. Searching
text is slow. Our eyes and brains aren’t very good at scanning text
quickly. And, ﬁnally, searching text is inefﬁcient in terms of retrieval.
You are going to get a lot of chaff and only a little wheat. All this
is true of search in manuscripts – it’s just as hard. But there is an
additional problem with searching through printed texts, namely, their
volume. It is one thing for you to look through your box of letters
for the embarrassing one you sent to your high school sweetheart. It’s
quite another for you to go to the British Library in search of War and
Peace. As the number of items you need to go through goes up, so does
the time it will take to ﬁnd the item you want. You aren’t much of a
correspondent, so your letter box contains thirty items. You’ll ﬁnd the

awkward missive you want quickly. But the acquisitions librarians at
the British Library are very acquisitive, as we’ve seen. It will take you
the better part of a year to ﬁnd War and Peace without one of their
handy ﬁnding-aids.
Like writing, then, print is not a very searchable medium, and it
becomes less searchable the more of it there is. It might be fun to
“Google” yourself in the universe of printed text, but you just can’t.
Egomania is a long, hard slog in the printed world. According to our
theory, media that are hard to search produce unmapped networks,
that is, networks that do not have a handy, efﬁcient system of addresses
with which one can easily track down information. On such networks,
ﬁnding and sharing information is difﬁcult, so data tend to become concentrated in certain nodes. By the lights of our theory, unmapped media
networks professionalize social practices developed in and around them.
As information pools in some nodes, unmapped networks naturally
generate information inequalities. These give those with precious information – experts – power over those who need it. The experts tend to
band together in order to perfect their knowledge and to maintain their
privilege, that is, they professionalize.
The early modern period witnessed the birth of the modern professions. Professions of a sort existed prior to Gutenberg, but they were
neither very many nor well organized. In most Manuscript Cultures, theologians, scholars, soldiers, and artisans of many kinds all made credible and somewhat enforceable claims to expert knowledge. They plainly
knew things other people did not, and sometimes they were members
of organizations – churches, universities, armies, guilds – that limited
access to special knowledge and restricted use of this knowledge in
practice. If these experts didn’t just “know” something, then they could
ﬁnd what needed to be found in the repositories of manuscripts they
controlled. Print weakened some old professions, but more importantly
created many strong new ones. An example of de-professionalization
is found in theology. Once held tightly by the medieval clergy, the
Scripture was, after Luther, available to a massive number of European
readers. Since they were all “priests” who could read and understand
the word of God for themselves, each became an expert after a fashion. The authorized expertise of the Catholic clergy lost value, and the
faith splintered into many dominations. An example of radical professionalization is found in the university. In the medieval period, subjects
147

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

of study were few – grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, music,
geometry, and astronomy – as were specialized faculties – theology,
law, medicine.141 Plato might have recognized the medieval university
as the successor of his Academy. He would not recognize the modern
university. Beginning in the nineteenth century, largely in Germany,
scholarship began to professionalize and simultaneously diversify.142
Educational reformers created serious systems of accreditation, a host
of new academic disciplines, and research facilities to support their
work – ﬁrst and foremost libraries. By the end of the nineteenth century, students could choose from hundreds of courses, arranged in many
disciplinary tracks, all leading to professional qualiﬁcations that gave
their holders the right to “practice.” Academic credentials became the
sine qua non of expert status in a bewildering host of new disciplines,
some old like medicine but most new like marketing, mortuary science,
and cosmetology.143 Each of these novel areas of expertise came to have
its own faculty, professional organization, and literature – printed and
housed in university libraries.
That was the “is” of the situation: it was hard to ﬁnd things in print
and this permitted people to horde valuable knowledge. The “ought”
that followed was a modern version of collectivism manifested in the
notion of professional duty, or simply “professionalism.” Of course the
idea of civic duty – that one was bound to serve the common interest – predates the Print Revolution by centuries: it is found in a wellelaborated form among the ancient Athenians, for instance.144 So too
is the related notion that some occupations entail higher obligations:
the Hippocratic Oath, written in the fourth century BC, offers a ready
example.145 But the concept that all occupations, professional and not,
entail civic obligations of a higher sort is a modern one. Weber noted
this in his discussion of the Protestant origins of the idea of occupational “callings.”146 The essence of the ethic of professionalism is that
everyone in society is obliged to everyone else and that the nature of
citizens’ obligations is determined by the work they do. In 1893, Emile
Durkheim captured this essence perfectly when he wrote that industrial societies were held together by means of “organic solidarity,” that
is, the cohesion which arises from the division of labor.147 The butcher
depends on the expertise of the baker for bread, while the baker depends
on the expertise of the butcher for meat. They cannot live well without one another and are therefore obliged to one another. The idea of
148

HOMO LECTOR

professional obligation evolved in two directions. The “weak” version,
predominant in capitalist countries, held that it was virtuous though not
necessary to trade expertise. If the baker didn’t want to sell bread to
the butcher, that was her “right,” though she would probably suffer a
certain amount of opprobrium for neglecting her “professional responsibility” as deﬁned by the Bakers’ Society. The “strong” version, found
in socialist countries, held that it was both virtuous and necessary to
trade expertise. The baker has no right not to sell bread to the butcher.
Rather, she has an obligation to contribute her baking expertise to the
collective. As Marx himself put it, “From each according to his ability,
to each according to his need.”148

Printing hardly appeared revolutionary in the ﬁrst decades after Gutenberg. Rather the contrary, it seemed terribly conservative. The Catholic
Church embraced the press as a means of spreading the faith. With the
help of numerous like-minded princes, the Holy See controlled much
of what was printed. The majority of texts printed were naturally religious, for example “Books of Hours” and “Lives of Saints.” Of course,
they were in Latin, the lingua sacra of the age. Early printed works even
looked like manuscript books. It’s clear now, however, that those who
thought Gutenberg’s “invention” would anchor Manuscript Culture
were wrong, for in a few short centuries print destroyed the old European order. This is somewhat surprising, for written and printed texts
are quite similar from a purely formal perspective. Both are linguistic
codes inscribed on substrates that are usually portable and often quite
durable. Yet print has physical attributes that make it a very different
tool than manuscript-writing. In this chapter we’ve tried to point out
these attributes, to show how they led to the creation of particular kinds
of media networks, and to suggest that these networks had a signiﬁcant impact on social practices and cultural values in early modern and
modern Europe. The sum and substance of what we have said in this
regard is sketched in Table 4.
Of course, print doesn’t necessarily nurture these effects or, when it
does, to the same degree. The natural tendencies of any medium can be
blunted with enough effort, and print is no exception. One can imagine
a scenario in which a few people controlled all printing presses, which in
turn were few in number. That would make print inaccessible. One can

further imagine that these few presses and the material they produced
had some peculiar characteristics, namely: they are impossible to hide –
making print very public; they produced nothing but text – making print
low ﬁdelity; they produce few texts – making print low volume; they
dispatch text at great speeds though not very far – making print high
velocity but low range; they print with vanishing ink – making print
very ephemeral; and, ﬁnally, they automatically produce a universal
index of terms – making print very searchable.
In principle, all this is possible. In practice, however, it is futile, or at
least very difﬁcult. Organized interests – churches, states, parties, corporations – have tried to rein in print for centuries. They have done so
in the pursuit of godliness and godlessness, democracy and domination,
liberalism and conservatism, capitalism and communism. But nowhere
have they ever really succeeded. In almost every case, print did what
print naturally does. This is part of the reason why modern societies,
from North Korea to the United States, all look “modern” as regards
print. They uniformly have large, diversiﬁed print industries. Some are
government-run and others private, but all are nominally devoted to
enlightening and entertaining “the people.” These industries produce
a huge amount of printed material for a far-ﬂung and usually highly
literate public. The leaders of all modern societies agree that literacy
is a necessity and reading a virtuous act. By and large, printed matter is produced in public and consumed in private, usually through
silent reading. The right to free expression and private consumption
is recognized, though not uniformly respected, the world over. Some
of what is printed is text, some of it pictures, and some of it both.

Low-brow content – melodrama, celebrity gossip, eroticism – is most
popular in both liberal and conservative states. There is also, however,
a place for the high-brow. That place is the university, where high-brow
print is made, and the library, where it steadily accumulates. These institutions are universal. In all modern societies, the professions are highly
developed, and each profession has its own “literature” that is known
well to professionals alone.
This, then, was Print Culture, the product of print itself and the
organized interests that “pulled” it into existence. It was tremendously
successful. Print Culture spanned the globe very quickly, and everywhere it went human societies became, eventually, more productive,
better governed, and more humane. But, as it happened, its reign was
short, lasting a mere 450 years. As we will see in the next chapter, the
Print Era was cut short by the arrival of a medium that did what print
could not – give people seemingly direct access to “experience.”

Humanity in the Age of Audiovisual Media

But I once heard a story I believe, I replied: How Leontius son of Aglaion,
coming from Piraeus under the outer north wall, perceived corpses laid out
near the gallows. He wanted to look, and at the same time he was disgusted
with himself and turned away; he fought with himself for awhile and covered
his face, but, overcome by desire, he held his eyes wide open and ran up to the
corpses and said “Look, damn you. Take your ﬁll of the lovely sight!”1
– Plato, The Republic, 439E–440A

Plato didn’t like artists, but he truly feared actors. Why? Because their
craft corrupts otherwise good people. Drama pretends to show us life
in all its richness, and it succeeds so well that it can and does trick
almost everyone. When viewers see an actor pretending to be in pain,
they are likely to feel as if they are witnessing actual pain. The really
frightening part, though, is that we enjoy sympathizing with dramatists
pretending to weep and wail, snort and chortle, and behave in all kinds
of undigniﬁed ways. Thus, we ﬁnd ourselves delighting in actions that
we would ordinarily condemn. Eventually, Plato predicts, drama will
corrupt us: if we view enough of it we will begin to act like the actors,
that is, badly. Our moral decline is inevitable so long as the actors
remain in the city, for so long as they do, we will compulsively seek
vicarious gratiﬁcation in their productions. Drama appeals so mightily
to our base instincts that we won’t be able to help ourselves. Thus,
almost all actors must be sent away if the city is to survive.
Most modern folks rightly ﬁnd Plato’s arguments against drama
unconvincing. That said, Plato makes one very good point about drama:
as an artistic medium, it is – or at least can be – extraordinarily compelling. We can put down a book when we don’t want to read it. We
152

HOMO VIDENS

can tune out poetry or music when we don’t want to listen. But when
we hear or see people, particularly if they are saying or doing something
odd, we feel we have to listen and look – just like Leontius in Plato’s
story. Leontius didn’t want to look at the corpses, but he had to. Plato
feared that if people were afforded the opportunity to see whatever they
wanted, then they, like Leontius, would lose control of themselves. In
this chapter, we will see that Plato’s fears were not misplaced. By the
mid-twentieth century, audiovisual media made it possible for anyone
to see almost anything. The consequences were just as Plato predicted,
for people did after a fashion lose control of themselves.

why we watch and listen
To demonstrate that the “pull” theory of media evolution is valid in
the case of audiovisual media, we need to establish two things. First,
we must show that we knew how to “do” audiovisual media before
we “did” them, at least very often or widely. If this was so, then we
can conﬁdently conclude that people could have employed audiovisual
media but didn’t because demand was too low. Second, we need to
show that some signiﬁcant historical disjuncture made existing media –
talking, writing, and printing – insufﬁcient for the purposes of some
organized group or groups, and that this or these groups developed a
preexisting technical capacity – in this case, audiovisual know-how –
into a real medium.
What sorts of evidence, primary and secondary, bear on these two
propositions? Since audiovisual media are both relatively new and by
and large persistent, the sources available to study them are much
greater than even those left to us by the Print Era, themselves very
considerable. Thus, it comes as no surprise that the secondary literature treating the origins and progress of telegraphy,2 photography,3
telephony,4 recorded sound,5 radio,6 motion pictures,7 and television8
is itself voluminous. That literature includes, fortunately, a number of
excellent surveys of all the audiovisual media.9 Moreover, and in contrast to the literature on the Talking Era, Manuscript Era, and Print
Era, scholars have paid abundant attention to ways in which electronic media have shaped modern society. For the past half-century,
it has been commonplace to say that the introduction of the “mass
media” (sometimes including print, and sometimes not) brought on
153

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

a “communications revolution” (sometimes “information revolution”)
that created an “information society” (sometimes “information age”).10
Whether, how, and to what degree audiovisual media actually did
change the patterns established during the Print Era is precisely the
question we will try to answer. In so doing, we will depend on this
prodigious body of scholarship.
Audiovisual Media before Audiovisual Media

As we will point out in a moment, humans really like to watch and listen. They have a natural and ineradicable hunger to see and hear certain
things. For most of human history – 140,000 years to be exact – this
hunger seems to have been satisﬁed by simply watching and listening to
what was naturally all around them, including each other. In this long
era, there were no artiﬁcial visual or sonic media, at least as far as we
know. That began to change about 40,000 years ago when our ancestors
started to draw, paint, and sculpt things.11 Judging by what they drew,
painted, and sculpted, they were very interested in what we are still very
interested in: sex, food, drink, power, wealth, conﬂict, and violence.
One of the earliest pieces of statuary archeologists have uncovered, the
24,000-year-old Venus de Willendorf, is a straightforward depiction of
a naked lady.12 And that was only the beginning. Wherever representational art ﬂourished in the Ancient World – Mesopotamia, Egypt, India,
China – we ﬁnd depictions of what might be called “racy things.” The
best known examples are doubtless the erotic murals of Pompeii and
Herculaneum, both of which were buried and thereby preserved by the
eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79.13 These depictions, often of sexual
acts, were clearly meant to arouse and not for any “higher purpose.” In
addition to the visual arts, our ancestors also used the performing arts
to represent this common set of racy things. Just when they began to do
so we do not know, for nothing survives. But it stands to reason that
prehistoric peoples performed rituals in which dramatic events were
reenacted. Why wouldn’t they? The same logic applies to early civilizations. We have scant evidence of Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Indian, or
Chinese dramaturgy, but it would be surprising if none existed given the
sophistication of these places. What we do know without doubt is that
by the time of Plato – the ﬁfth century BC – the dramatic arts were both
highly developed and very popular in the Hellenic World.14 They were
154

HOMO VIDENS

also controversial, as we can see in Plato’s spirited condemnation of
them.15 Plato didn’t like drama for a variety of reasons, but one of the
most salient relates precisely to the playwright’s favorite subject: people
behaving badly. Arrogance, lust, greed, envy, hatred, spite, malice, and
cruelty – these were the dramaturge’s best friends. We know the reason:
these were the things people wanted to see.
This was true in ancient Athens and after. Yet, for nearly 1,500
years, the technology designed to deliver representations of racy things
remained unchanged. You could draw them. You could sculpt them.
You could enact them. But that was all you could do. And actually
“you” probably couldn’t do any of these things, at least very well. The
graphic, plastic, and dramatic arts are, well, arts. Performing them with
any proﬁciency requires talent, training, and resources. Most common
folk in the Manuscript Era didn’t have any of these things. Thus they
were consumers, not producers, of high-quality art. But high-quality art
wasn’t easy to come by for two reasons. The ﬁrst was economic: really
good representations – well-wrought paintings, sculpture, and drama –
were going to be expensive. The elite could afford them, but most plebs
couldn’t. The second was logistical: even in the cases where good art was
affordable, there were real limits on the size of the audiences that could
view it. Stadia, hippodromes, amphitheaters, and circuses could only
be so numerous and so big, a fact we will return to later.16 These two
considerations – scarcity and audience size – meant that many people in
the Manuscript Era were not going to get to see or hear the things they
wanted to see or hear. This was true in Plato’s time and it remained
true more than a millennium later in Shakespeare’s day. To put the
quandary in terms only an economist could love: by creating a limited
and inelastic supply of stimulating ﬁne arts, Manuscript- and Print-Era
cultures systematically generated “excess demand” for them. The bright
lights of Uruk, Athens, Rome, and London whetted appetites, but could
not slake them.
Yet common people did not riot over the high cost of ﬁne art or
theater, at least the way they rioted over the cost of bread when it was
dear. They made their own fun of the representational sort, most of
which is lost to history. Throughout the Manuscript and Print Eras,
the commoner’s calendar was full of festivals, fairs, and games, all of
which allowed ordinary folk both to let off steam and to see things
represented that they could not in their daily lives.17 This tradition still
155

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

survives in the form of the annual Purim celebrations in the Jewish world
and Carnival celebrations in the Christian world. Your local county
and state fairs might also be cited in this regard. These folk traditions
went some way toward satisfying people’s appetites for aural and visual
stimulation, and thereby reduced social pressure. But just as important
were the positive measures taken to reduce the appetite itself. From
Plato to Shakespeare and even after, the authorities – especially literate
princes and priests – told people that some representations could do
tangible harm and should, therefore, be strenuously avoided.18 Graven
images, depictions of heaven, polyphonic music and such might offend
the deities, which would naturally provoke their wrath. No one wanted
that. Masques, mummers’ plays, and political ditties might offend powerful persons, which would provoke their wrath. And no one wanted
that. So it was more or less taken for granted in the Manuscript and
Print Eras that there were certain things that one could not safely draw,
sculpt, or play because they were “unholy” or “dishonorable.”
But the basic problem remained, an endemic characteristic of
Manuscript and Print Cultures: too much demand for audiovisual stimulation and not enough supply. To right this imbalance, some means
had to be found to lower the cost of producing representations of racy
things. As we’ve seen, the purveyors of print – experts at lowering production costs – were the ﬁrst to attempt a solution. From the earliest
days of printing, publishers realized that pictures helped push their textual products.19 Thus, they made sure to complement their printed texts
with engravings, the more suggestive of immorality the better. They also
pushed for ever more accurate pictures, but this almost always meant
the employment of better etchers and etching techniques. Photography never occurred to them. Of course it never occurred to anyone,
or almost anyone, before the early nineteenth century. The notion that
you could mechanically capture what your eyes had seen was an odd
one, as we don’t experience anything like it in nature beyond shadows
and reﬂections – and they disappear. Nonetheless, by the seventeenth
century both of the ideas necessary to produce photographs – the pinhole camera effect and the photochemical effect – were ﬂoating around
Europe, waiting for someone to put them together.20 Nicéphore Niépce
ﬁnally did in the 1830s.21 Thereafter, there was a rush of activity aimed
at bringing photography bearing racy things to market. Photos could
be inexpensively reproduced as early as the 1840s and were. Photos
156

HOMO VIDENS

could be printed in newspapers, magazines, and books by the 1880s
and were.22
But it still wasn’t enough, and entrepreneurs knew that. Yet, much
like the printers before photography, they opted for more of the same.
Most historians recognize the nineteenth century as the moment at
which leisure was commodiﬁed in the Western world, or at least became
a lot more commodiﬁed than it had ever been.23 Folk art, folk theater,
and folk music had always existed in Europe. But generally speaking,
these were not things people paid for, or paid very much for. The
only form of “popular entertainment” that required the expenditure of
brass was drinking, and it was the most popular entertainment of all.
In the nineteenth century, though, entrepreneurs expanded the concept
of entertainment for hire beyond its traditional boundaries. They did it
by going down-market with up-market things, giving the rising middle
classes – who had money to spare and time to spend it – what their betters had had all along, though at a cheaper price. These entrepreneurs
opened opera houses, professional theaters, music halls, variety shows,
seaside resorts, mountain retreats, and country reposes. It was all very
respectable, indeed, a bit too respectable for the tastes of some (predominantly male) parts of the audience. They wanted to see and hear
more, and the mavens of entertainment were only too glad to accommodate them if the censors would play along. In the end, they did, and
so vaudeville, cabaret, burlesque, and striptease were born.24
With both prosperity and population on the rise, more of the same
was not going to do the job. Entertainment entrepreneurs needed to
ﬁnd a way to supply large audiences with cheap audiovisual diversions.
The technologies they needed to accomplish this feat were available,
but they were generally buried too deeply in esoteric scientiﬁc discoveries and crude prototypes for anyone to realize it. This accounts for
the lag between the discovery or invention of sound recording, movies,
radio, and TV and their commercialization.25 The ﬁrst device capable of
recording sound was Edouard-Leon Scott’s “phonoautograph” in 1857.
Sound recordings were not brought to market before Thomas Edison’s
phonograph cylinders in the 1880s and Emile Berliner’s gramophone
discs in the 1890s. The precursors to motion pictures – the ﬂip book, the
Zoetrope – were all in circulation decades before Eadweard Muybridge
began his experiments with “serial photography” in the late 1870s.
It wasn’t until the late 1890s that Edison and the Lumière brothers
157

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

succeeded in commercializing ﬁlm, and it was long after that before the
movies assumed their modern form. It’s impossible to tell who “discovered” radio, because bits and pieces of it were conceptualized or
demonstrated by several scientists over a long period. David E. Hughes
(1879), Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (1887), Nikola Tesla (1893), Oliver
Lodge (1894), Jagdish Chandra Bose (1894), and Alexander Popov
(1895) could all reasonably be called the “inventors” of wireless. After
being granted a patent in 1896, Guglielmo Marconi began to sell the
technology, primarily for ship-to-shore communications. The ﬁrst recognizably commercial radio stations, however, were not organized until
the 1920s. It’s also hard to say who “discovered” television because
so many people did. Paul Nipkow (1884), Vladimir Zworykin (1923),
John Logie Baird (1925), and Philo Farnsworth (1927) are all good candidates for the honor – if such it be – of “Inventor of Television.” The
ﬁrst commercial television broadcasts were not made until the 1930s,
and the technology was not really widely adopted until the 1950s.
Although it took some time for corporations to see the potential of
audiovisual technologies and to organize the industry, when they did,
audiovisual media spread at a rate faster than any medium in history.
By the 1920s, both gramophones and records were common items in
middle-class households in the industrialized world.26 The music industry stagnated during the Great Depression and World War II, but by the
late 1960s, it had recovered to the point that “stereos” and “LPs” were
ubiquitous. So they remain today, though both the playback devices
and recordings are digital. The story is much the same for ﬁlm.27 By
1930, some 80 million Americans, or 65 percent of the total population, were going to the movies once a week.28 Attendance rates dipped
during the Great Depression, rose again beginning in 1933, and then
started to fall after World War II with the proliferation of television. Of
course, in that same postwar period, the consumption of movies in all
formats (ﬁlm, video, DVD) increased and the habit of movie-watching
spread all over the world. According to one estimate, in excess of 9.6
billion movie tickets are sold worldwide each year.29 And the tale is
similar for radio and TV.30 In the United Kingdom, where we can track
diffusion with reasonable accuracy thanks to state regulation, 125,000
radio reception licenses were issued in 1923. Twenty years later, around
10 million were being issued annually. In 1947, 15,000 TV licenses were
given out in Great Britain. Twenty years later, over 14 million were
158

HOMO VIDENS

issued.31 Today, nearly every household in the developed world has at
least one radio and TV, and most have more than one. According to an
estimate in the CIA World Factbook, there were over 2.5 billion radios
and 1.4 billion televisions in the world in 1997, the last date for which
data are available.32 One imagines that there are many, many more
today.
“Pulling” the Audiovisual Media into Existence

Beyond the fact that people are genetically predisposed to enjoy listening
and watching, and beyond the fact that the technology to make listening
and watching easy was available, why did audiovisual media take off
with such rapidity in the twentieth century? According to our “pull”
theory of media adoption, the answer should be that newly evolved
organized interests, having found existing media insufﬁcient for their
purposes, began to forcefully seek out – indeed create – new media, in
this case of the audiovisual variety. It’s not at all difﬁcult to demonstrate
that this was the case. Print was “pulled” into being by the advent of
mercantile capitalists, state administrators, and pastors – all of whom
found the new medium very useful. By the late eighteenth century, it
was evident that all three of these organized interests were undergoing signiﬁcant change: mercantile capitalism was becoming industrial
capitalism, the bureaucratic state was becoming the welfare state, and
reading religion was becoming cultural liberalism. It is in these transformations that we will look for – and ﬁnd – the increase in demand
that “pulled” audiovisual media into widespread use.
First, consider industrial capitalism.33 The essence of mercantile capitalism was trade, the movement of goods from a place where they
could be purchased for a low price to another place where they could
be sold for a higher price. Buy spices here cheaply; transport them there
and sell them dearly. Mercantile capitalism required a lot of paperwork, and therefore those who practiced it had to have some facility
with reading and writing. The essence of industrial capitalism was production, the organized manufacture of goods to be sold in a market.
Make widgets and sell them to people who need widgets. This practice, too, required literacy. But it required other skills as well. The most
important of these for our purpose was what we might call “market creation.” Unlike the mercantile capitalist who connected existing supply
159

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

and demand – spices and a hunger for spices – the industrial capitalist
actively looked for new supplies to fulﬁll as yet unrecognized demands.
The merchant capitalists asks, “What do people want, and how can I
ﬁnd it and bring it to them?” The industrial capitalist asks, “What use
might there be for this thing, and how do I convince people that they
need it?” To put this difference in mentality and practice in the shortest
possible terms: the mercantile capitalist transports, while the industrial
capitalist makes and sells.
Engineering and marketing are the handmaidens of industrial capitalism. We can see how they worked together in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries to stimulate demand for audiovisual media. By the
mid-nineteenth century, European cities were ﬁlling up with people who
had both the means and desire to be entertained. Entrepreneurs met
this demand by building more theaters, music halls, and resorts. But,
as we’ve seen, it wasn’t enough. By the last quarter of the nineteenth
century, it was clear to forward-looking engineer-entrepreneurs such
as Edison, Berliner, and Marconi that a technical “ﬁx” to the problem
was within reach. They went about implementing it in the way that had
become customary in industrial economies: they ﬁled patents, held exhibitions of their “inventions,” sought ﬁnancial backing, formed public
companies, and hired publicists to convince politicians that their products would serve the national interest and convince consumers that they
could not really do without them. They succeeded beyond their wildest
dreams. Why? Because there was immense latent demand for the products they wanted to bring to market. That hidden hunger, however,
had existed unfulﬁlled for a very long time. We can be pretty sure that
Plato would have listened to records, gone to the movies, tuned into the
radio, and watched TV had he the chance. He never did, and neither did
anyone else in the Talking, Manuscript, or Print Eras. The explanation
for this, we like to say, is that the technical capacity to build audiovisual technologies didn’t exist then. That’s true. But it is also – and
perhaps more importantly – because nothing like industrial capitalism
existed then. Industrial capitalism gave men like Edison, Berliner, and
Marconi a reason to create marketable new technologies and a means
to build companies to produce and sell them. Industrial capitalism
worked a kind of magic: it transformed hazy mass desire into effective
demand.

160

Second, consider the welfare state.34 The early modern European
state was dedicated to two activities: making war and collecting taxes
so it could make war. The princes knew more or less how to ﬁght
battles, as that was really all their forbearers, the medieval aristocracy,
did. But collecting taxes, especially the very large amounts of revenue
that early modern armies required, took them into new administrative
territory. They found that in order to ensure a sizeable and steady ﬂow
of cash, they needed to ﬁeld large bureaucracies. Large bureaucracies, in
turn, meant increased demand for literate bureaucrats; hence, demand
for the skills of reading and writing. The literate bureaucrats were
still there when the European states took on a new mission in the
late nineteenth century. That mission was public welfare. In medieval
and early modern Europe, most princes ruled by some sort of divine
right. They did God’s will ﬁrst and the people’s will second. If the
two coincided, good. If not, then you just had to put up with it. The
American and French Revolutions marked the beginning of the end of
all that. After these epochal events, only governments “of the people, by
the people, for the people” (in Lincoln’s memorable phrase) would be
deemed truly legitimate.35 There had been murmurs and more of this
new mission before 1776 and 1789. The eighteenth-century Prussian
absolutist Fredrick the Great, for example, reportedly proclaimed that
he was merely “ﬁrst servant of the state.”36 He apparently thought
that serving the state meant making war as often and as violently as he
could, for that is what he did. His late nineteenth-century successors
had different ideas of state service. Otto von Bismarck was no lover of
liberalism or socialism, yet he found it expedient to create national labor
laws, health insurance, disability insurance, and pensions for masses
of Germans.37 He found it expedient exactly because he feared the
liberals and socialists were winning popular support by advocating
these paternalistic policies. That was something to be avoided, so he
stole their thunder. He was hardly alone. By the end of World War I,
the entire Western political spectrum was shifting toward soft or hard
socialism. Both liberal and conservative regimes answered the popular
call for the creation of a social safety net.
The newly powerful masses also clamored, however, for “modern”
conveniences. Among these we ﬁnd audiovisual media, and particularly the telephone, radio, and television. People saw these things and

161

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

they wanted them. Politicians saw that there was political hay to be
made by helping constituents get them.38 Moreover, there were compelling economic reasons for some sort of central coordination of these
emerging networks. Combine these two reasons with the fact that European regimes already controlled telegraphy – the ﬁrst electronic network – and you have a compelling case for state support and control
of the new audiovisual media. So it happened that European countries
generally opted for state-run telephone networks, as well as taxpayersubsidized national radio and television broadcasting services, the BBC
being the most familiar example. The ﬁlm industry was also heavily
subsidized in Europe, and is to this day. The United States took a different path, electing for predominately private telegraphy, telephony,
ﬁlm making, radio, and TV. Yet, even in the land of free enterprise,
government regulation was extensive, as evidenced by the formation of
the Federal Radio Commission in 1927 and its powerful successor, the
Federal Communications Commission in 1934. And outright federal
support of broadcasting is hardly unknown in the United States, as can
be seen in the examples of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. Modern states are welfare states, and welfare states
make sure their citizens have things to listen to and watch.
Finally, consider cultural liberalism.39 The pastors of early modern Europe generally wanted their ﬂocks to be able to read and write.
They made efforts to see that they learned, and were generally supported in their pro-literacy activities by princes. Literacy rates rose.
But it certainly was not the case that princes and pastors wanted their
subjects to write and read anything. On the contrary, they had reasonably serious – and by our standards very restrictive – notions of what
was proper and improper written material. Every early modern European regime and faith practiced censorship. So too did they regulate,
or attempt to regulate, what could be heard and viewed.40 Theaters
were licensed, popular entertainments monitored, and even dress was
regulated by “sumptuary laws.” As we’ve pointed out, restrictions on
what could be written, read, heard, and seen began to fall away with
the rise of the idea of the free press in the early modern period. In hindsight, we can see that if ever there was a conceptual and legal slippery
slope, the notion of the free press was it. For once it was conceded that
(a) the government’s power to censor representations could be abridged

162

HOMO VIDENS

and (b) representations have no obvious corrupting effect, so then (c) it
became very difﬁcult to halt the expansion of the “freedom of expression.” The ﬁrst threshold was crossed in the seventeenth century when
political speech was granted as a right, at least to some and in some
circumstances.41 This act opened the door for formerly outré expressions by giving them legal cover. Thus, obscene political cartoons came
to be seen as less obscene and more political. What might be called the
“sticks-and-stones” doctrine (“Sticks and stones may break my bones,
but words will never hurt me”), however, was not fully articulated until
the later nineteenth or even early twentieth centuries, though it was not
fully accepted even then. Members of the Free Speech League (1902) in
the United States, for example, argued that “obscenity” was a matter of
taste, that it was not at all obvious that “obscene” material harmed its
consumers, and that it seemed certain that it didn’t harm anyone else if
consumed privately.42 These were good arguments, and they were hard
to rebut in the progressive legal climate of the day. But they were not
found persuasive by the self-appointed guardians of public morality or
the courts.43
They were, however, found compelling by most people, at least those
who ﬂocked to the movies to see every manner of impropriety. Even in
the beginning of cinema sex and violence sold. Despite the fact that the
people had voted with their feet, however, neither the government nor
the wardens of propriety had given up the battle against “obscenity.”44
In the United States, for instance, the states could and did censor ﬁlms
well into the twentieth century. American secular and religious groups
mounted sustained attacks on what they deemed “immoral” ﬁlms. In
order to protect their booming industry, then, the movie moguls needed
to do something to appease the censors and critics. This gesture took
the form of the famous Hay’s Code of 1930, under which the studios
agreed to censor themselves. What needs to be recognized, however, is
that although we look back on the Hay’s Code as outright censorship, it
permitted a lot more than it banned. You could go to the movies in the
1930s, 1940s, and 1950s and see all the sex, violence, and illicit behavior
you wanted, though everyone kept their clothes on and refrained from
cursing. It wasn’t propriety, but the veneer of propriety. And that’s
just the way everyone wanted it, from the guardians of morality to the
Supreme Court to the average moviegoer.

Audiovisual Media and Human Nature

Audiovisual media, once properly engineered for mass consumption,
took off very quickly. There was, as we expected, a lag between the
capacity to “do” audiovisual things and the creation of full-ﬂedged
audiovisual media. But it was comparatively short. It took about
175,000 years for manuscript-writing to become established, and even
then its penetration was low. It took roughly 1,000 years for printing
to become established, and even today its coverage is not complete. But
it took only a few decades for audiovisual media to cover the world
and saturate all the populations in it. A signiﬁcant number of people today cannot read or write. A signiﬁcant number of people today
do not read or write though they can. But virtually everyone alive,
if they are healthy, can watch and listen to audiovisual media – and
they do, a lot. Part of the reason for the rapid spread and remarkable penetration of audiovisual media no doubt has to do with the
power of modern states and enterprises to provide them cheaply to
the masses. But obviously this is not the whole story. If it were, then
everyone would be able to read and would do so often, for states and
enterprises also provide literacy and literature at low cost. No, there
is something about the audiovisual media that is different. And we
know just what it is: humans love to watch and listen. Not to everything, but to a certain class of things. As we’ll see, this fact goes a
long way toward explaining why we watch and listen in the way that
we do.
We talk compulsively, though we don’t really realize it. The same is
true of listening and watching. Most of us think that we listen to what
we want and look at what we will. It’s a comforting notion insofar as
it conforms with our rather prideful belief that we have unfettered free
will. It has the further beneﬁt of being partially true, which is never
a bad thing for a notion to be. Forcing someone to listen or look at
something attentively is difﬁcult. In Anthony Burgess’s dystopian novel
A Clockwork Orange, the evil state, believing that wayward people
could be “rehabilitated” by prolonged exposure to horrible sounds
and images, built an elaborate contraption to do the job.45 Criminals
were strapped into chairs, had their eyelids mechanically peeled back,
and were given drugs to heighten awareness. In the real world we use
similar attention-focusing techniques of a much milder sort: schools
164

HOMO VIDENS

conﬁne students to classrooms, churches conﬁne congregants to pews,
and companies conﬁne employees to cubicles. As everyone knows, these
methods often fail. Who hasn’t slept in a classroom, a church service,
or at work? But the fact that no one can really compel you to listen
to or look at something doesn’t mean that you can listen or look at
anything you like. Your ability to do so is constrained by two factors.
First, there’s only so much material available in any given time and
place. If you are in a large art museum, there’s a lot to see. If you are on
the frozen tundra, there’s not. Second, and much more important, there
are some sounds and sights that seem to draw our attention whether we
like it or not. These might be called “intrusive stimuli.” Some are sonic:
whispering, lisps, bad music, good music, crying babies, shrieking girls,
shouting men, barking dogs, hissing cats, alarms, gunﬁre. Some are
visual: surpassing beauty, unclaimed money, low-cut blouses, drooling,
celebrities, explosions, disheveled street people, disﬁgured faces, open
wounds, bloody brawls, car accidents, dead bodies, guns. What all
these things have in common is that they are “ear catching” and “eye
catching.” We are drawn to listen to them and look at them even though
we sometimes don’t want to. We want to tune them out. We want to
turn away. But we can’t. Just as we must talk, we must listen and we
must look.
The similarity is deeper. Just as we are compelled to talk about
certain kinds of things, so too are we compelled to listen and look
at certain kinds of things. In fact, they are essentially the same – the
relevant ones. As we explained, human speech and reason evolved in
part as the result of an age-old competition to gain allies. In what we
called the “relevance game,” our ancestors attempted to prove their
worth to others by presenting relevant facts, that is, interesting tidbits
of information that would improve the ﬁtness of their interlocutors. The
more relevance individuals brought, the better allies they would be, and
the more allies they would have. The number and quality of allies in
turn translated into increased reproductive success. What’s important
to remember is that success in the relevance game depended not only
on the ability to present and test relevance – both of which relied on
speech and reason – but also the capacity to uncover relevance to be
presented. Those who were better at ﬁnding relevance would naturally
enjoy greater reproductive success than those who were worse. This
difference, and the advantage it entailed, stimulated the evolution of
165

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

sensory hardware and software that made the hunt for relevance more
efﬁcient.
This is to say no more than that the human ears and eyes, together
with the software that runs them, were specially tuned to pay close
attention to certain kinds of aural and visual signals, namely, the relevant ones, the ones that matter to us and to people we might talk to. In
Chapter 1, we said that these intrusive signals could be grouped under
two general headings: anomalies and puzzles. Nothing will draw our
attention like something that shouldn’t be there. The human mind is a
remarkable pattern-building and pattern-recognizing machine. It is so
primed to create models that it often sees regularity where there is none,
as is evidenced by the fact that people habitually see patterns in random
processes where they do not exist. If you roll a six-sided die three times
and get six on each roll, you will somehow expect a six on the next roll,
though there is no good reason to do so if the die is fair. Even if you
understand the laws of probability and know that the die is unweighted,
you will somehow sense that it may not be fair after all. You intuit that
there is something wrong, something that doesn’t “add up.” This in
turn triggers your inborn reﬂex for puzzle-solving. You will attempt to
“ﬁgure it out,” to square the anomaly with your world-picture. What’s
most interesting is that you will do this even at considerable risk to
yourself, even where your investigative behavior doesn’t appear to be
rational in terms of cold, hard cost-beneﬁt analysis. Measuring the die
might be a rational way to investigate the fairness of the game, as it is
low risk. Calling the person who handed you the die a cheater might
not be, but you might do that anyway just to judge his or her reaction.
Hopefully it won’t be a poke in the nose, but you can never tell.
Your ears and eyes, then, are designed to draw your attention to
anomalies and make you investigate them whether you like it or not. But
there is good reason to suspect that there is another class of much more
speciﬁc intrusive stimuli that you were pre-programmed to hear and see.
This is easy to demonstrate. In our world there is nothing anomalous or
puzzling about a picture of a naked lady. Such pictures are practically
everywhere. But despite their commonality, if you are a heterosexual
male, your attention will be drawn by these images almost whenever
and wherever they are presented. Even in cases where you feel ethically
uneasy about looking at them, or feel that tangible harm will come to
you if you do, you will still be drawn to look. As in the case of Leontius,
166

HOMO VIDENS

your reason tells you one thing – do the moral thing, protect yourself –
but your eyes and instincts tell you another – look, look now. Often,
however, conscious reason never comes into play because it all happens
too fast: the image appears, you unthinkingly look, and only then do you
feel you’ve done something immoral or unsafe. For heterosexual males,
pictures of naked ladies fall into the category of “relevance reﬂexes”:
signals that almost always trigger an automatic perceptual response.
Although the exact catalogue of such signals is unknown, our own
experience provides us with a fair guide to the basic set. In addition
to sexual imagery, we can reasonably add food, drink, power, wealth,
conﬂict, and violence – the “racy things” we mentioned earlier. During
our evolution, these speciﬁc stimuli were always relevant because they
often had a tangible impact on our ﬁtness. Their importance was so
universal that there was no reason for the mind to waste energy deciding
whether they mattered or not. They almost always mattered. Thus, over
the course of millions of years, our response to them became reﬂexive.
They were made part of the elementary program that guides human
behavior, not unlike the program embedded in the autonomic nervous
system. In this limited sense, we have no more control over what we
listen to and look at than we do over whether our hearts pump or our
lungs breathe.
Industrial capitalism, the welfare state, and cultural liberalism
“pulled” the modern audiovisual media into existence. They were able
do this so rapidly and completely because we love to watch and listen. The purveyors of manuscript literacy and print opened a door and
forced people through it; the purveyors of the audiovisual media opened
a door, and people, of their own volition, rushed in.

what audiovisual media did
In the modern era, then, the media environment comprised of talking,
manuscript-writing, and print became even more complicated with the
addition of audiovisual media. Bear in mind that the latter did not
supplant the former – media, as we’ve said, accumulate over time. Neither did audiovisual media come to dominate human communications.
Older media remained very useful in the era of movies, radios, TVs, and
the rest. People talked, and perhaps even more than before thanks to
the telephone. In 1990, at the height of the Audiovisual Era, Americans
167

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

were making 9.5 billion calls a day.46 People wrote, and doubtless even
more than before thanks to mass literacy and marked improvements in
the post. In 1990, the U.S. Postal Service handled over 166 billion pieces
of mail.47 Just how many of them were handwritten letters we don’t
know, but even if it was a tiny fraction, say 1 percent, that amounts
to 166 million manuscripts. And of course people produced and read
print, again more than before thanks to mass literacy and improvements
in printing technology. In 1990, almost 43,000 new books and editions
were published in the United States.48 That’s book titles, not copies.
If the average print run was in the range of 1,000 copies, that would
amount to 43 million books in that year alone.
Our “push” theory of media effects predicts that audiovisual media
should have altered the social practices and values of Print Culture; they
should have generated a distinct Audiovisual Culture in the distinct
Audiovisual Era (1850 to 1990). As we’ve already noted, there are
ample primary and secondary sources available to test these predictions,
and we will use them liberally in all that follows.
Accessibility

We noted previously that print was both accessible and inaccessible,
depending on whether you were a sender or recipient of it. The same is
true of audiovisual media, only much more so.
Beginning on the send side, anyone who has ever seen the inside of
a modern radio or television station knows that the tools and skills
necessary to produce and send audiovisual signals are expensive. The
equipment itself – sound stages, microphones, cameras, transmitters,
signal towers, satellites, and so on – does not come cheap. You can’t
afford it if you are not Ted Turner. Even if you had a fully equipped
studio and the wherewithal to send signals from it, you wouldn’t know
how to use any of it without extensive training. A degree in television
or radio production would come in very handy. Once you had your
studio and knew how to use it, you’d still have to produce something
to broadcast. This is no easy feat. You don’t just whip up an evening
news broadcast or a sitcom. So you’ll need degrees in journalism and
the dramatic arts as well. Yet you’ll never be able to acquire and learn
to do all of these things. No individual could. That’s why audiovisual
media are produced and transmitted by large teams of people. Directors
168

HOMO VIDENS

get all the credit for great ﬁlms, but it’s the army of people on the crew
who do all the heavy lifting. Not only is audiovisual production naturally expensive, it’s not that hard to make it more costly by artiﬁcial
means. This is because audiovisual media, like print, present those who
would control it with a nice logistical bottleneck, a stage in the production and distribution process that is particularly vulnerable. With
audiovisual media, it’s the studio and transmission facilities themselves
that cannot (with the partial exception of radio) be hidden. This is
why tyrannical governments always control the airwaves and ﬁll them
with self-serving garbage. In such an environment, the cost of private
transmission is death, and that’s a high price to pay.
On the receive side, the tools and skills necessary to get and understand audiovisual signals are generally cheap. In terms of equipment, all
you need is a box, either a radio or a TV. Like almost all mass-produced
electronics, these items became less expensive as the twentieth century
progressed. Eventually, even people of moderate income could afford
them, and they became nearly universal in the free, developed world.
Today, radios and televisions are everywhere. As for skills, you need
none. You do not have a reading organ, so you need to learn to read. But
you do have listening and watching organs, so you don’t need to learn
anything at all to listen to the radio or watch the TV. It’s possible that
there are people who, for whatever neurological reason, just don’t “get”
the box. They don’t understand where the voices come from, or how
large, three-dimensional people become small, two-dimensional people.
But if such unfortunates exist, they are rare exceptions. A comprehension test of audiovisual media has now been performed on billions of
people, and the results are clear: almost everyone “gets” radio, TV, and
the movies immediately. Now, the degree to which people “get” them
varies considerably. You may not “understand” an art-house movie
due to a “cultural barrier.” If it’s in a foreign language, then you may
not “understand” it due to a “language barrier.” But your lack of full
comprehension doesn’t mean you don’t “get” it at all. Billions of people
all over the world consume audiovisual media – particularly American
music, television, and ﬁlms – that they don’t “understand” in either
of these senses. But they seem to “get” them enough to enjoy watching or listening to them, for they both watch and listen avidly. Not
only are audiovisual media cheap to get and consume, they are difﬁcult
to make more expensive than they naturally are. This doesn’t mean it
169

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

can’t be done. A despotic government could make it illegal to own a
radio and TV receivers. But even despots are loath to take this step
because it would deny them the opportunity to use radio and TV for
propagandistic purposes. The trouble is that, once the boxes are widely
disseminated, they can be used to receive “subversive” foreign broadcasts. The Soviet leadership made the reception of foreign broadcasts
illegal and even attempted to jam their signals.49 Nonetheless, millions
of Soviet citizens daily tuned into Deutsche Welle, the Voice of America,
and the BBC. Finnish television was very popular as well (it aired the
TV series Dallas).50
Thus, audiovisual media are inaccessible on the send side and accessible on the receive side. As such, they foster a dual network. On the
send side, the network is concentrated: control of the means to produce and transmit audiovisual signals is held by a few nodes. On the
receive side, the network is diffused: a large percentage of those in the
network will have the ability to receive signals. This is what is commonly called a “one-to-many” network, meaning that a few nodes send
messages to many nodes, and the many nodes do not send messages
back. Such a description ﬁts audiovisual media perfectly. Following our
theory, a dual network will both hierarchicalize and equalize social
practices evolved in and around it. Concentrated networks encourage
the formation of ranks, while diffused networks work in the opposite
direction.
On the send side, hierarchicalization can clearly be seen in modern audiovisual networks. After an initial scramble, the motion picture
industry in the United States simpliﬁed to a number of big players all
coordinated into the “Hollywood system”: Fox, Paramount, Warner,
MGM, and RKO (the “Big Five”) plus United Artists, Universal, and
Columbia (the “Little Three”).51 Similar concentration took place in the
radio industry, with NBC (1926), CBS (1927), and ABC (1943) emerging as the dominant players.52 When television was ﬁnally launched en
masse in the 1950s, the “Big Three” networks dominated it as well. Outside the United States, the situation was different as governments almost
uniformly initiated or nationalized radio and television networks.53
That was the “is” of the situation: a few nodes in the network
would control all production and transmission of broadcast audiovisual materials. The “ought” depended on the way hegemony was established. In the United States, it was argued that corporate domination of
170

HOMO VIDENS

audiovisual media was a natural result of the operation of free enterprise and free speech, both of which were hallowed principles. In this
peculiarly odd view, the big media companies were simply victors in
the marketplace and the “marketplace of ideas.” If anyone thought
they could do better, they were free to try. “Market entry,” as the
economists have it, proved singularly difﬁcult until the era of cable television, and even then was no easy trick. The “marketplace of ideas,”
therefore, did not (and does not) operate as the Founding Fathers or
Mill might have hoped.54 In Europe, members of the Vanguard Party
argued that the state had to control audiovisual media in order to protect “the people” from harmful private interests, precisely the kind that
dominated the media in the United States. This logic had the odd effect
of making politicians into art critics, a role they were singularly unﬁt
to play. Sometimes the result of taking audiovisual media from “the
people” in order to make it the “people’s media” were benign, as in
the case of the UK’s BBC. Other times it wasn’t, as in the case of the
USSR’s ITAR-TASS.
On the receive side, equalization is just as apparent. We see it most
notably in the formation of the “masses” or “mass society.” In the
Manuscript and Print Eras, there were many different audiences: literate and oral, elite and common, this confession and that confession,
this region and that region. In the nineteenth century, with the introduction of mass print publications and the rise of mass literacy, this
began to change. Ever larger audiences began to form, a phenomenon
noted early on by many observers. In 1932, for example, José Ortega y
Gasset wrote of the emergence of the “mass man.”55 The rapid spread
of the audiovisual media, particularly following World War II, accelerated this process of “mass-iﬁcation.” Both capitalist enterprises and
communist parties saw the value in audiovisual media and worked to
make sure that everyone would have access to them. To be sure, their
motives were quite different: the capitalists wanted to sell soap and the
communists wanted to sell the party line. But the result was the same:
nearly universal access to a small set of audiovisual signals. The varied,
smallish audiences of Manuscript and early Print Culture were thereby
united into mass audiences of “listeners” and “viewers,” all of whom
are equal and all of whom have one “vote” (their attention). This phenomenon, too, was noted by observers. In 1956, for example, C. Wright
Mills wrote a classic treatment of “mass society.”56
171

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

That was the “is” of the situation: everyone was going to listen
and watch, and moreover to the same (often bad) things. The “ought”
that followed was a peculiar twist on egalitarianism by which the mass
consumption of audiovisual media was intertwined with the notion of
democratic citizenship. The idea that the free press – both the right to
send printed materials and to receive them – was essential to democracy
and cultural enrichment had already been established in the nineteenth
century. Free-press doctrine was applied to the audiovisual media as
well but it meant different things on the send and receive sides. On the
send side, it was a merely formal right: any citizen was free to transmit
audiovisual signals within the conﬁnes of the state’s regulatory structure, though only those with the means – that is, the very wealthy or
powerful – could actually do so, at least to large audiences. On the
receive side, however, it was, or rather became, a substantive right:
any citizen could listen and watch the audiovisual media. Now most
of what was “on” – music, game shows, sitcoms, sports – had nothing to do with the workings of democracy or cultural enrichment. But
some of it did: news, election coverage, government announcements,
and the various high-brow offerings like those found on Soviet television and American PBS. Programming of this sort was enough to allow
politicians and industry lobbyists to claim that listening and watching constituted “participation” in the democratic process and national
cultural life. This argument provided the opening necessary for state
regulation and public subvention of the audiovisual media: the government needed to make sure the right things were broadcast and that
everyone had access.57 Thus, access to the media – and television in
particular – became a sort of tacit right.58
Privacy

We saw that printing is usually public, but reading print is private,
or at least can be made so reasonably inexpensively. It’s the same with
audiovisual media: transmitting is public, receiving is private, or at least
often so in practice.
On the send side, it’s difﬁcult to hide the fact that you are broadcasting signals from a radio or television station. The reason is that you
are broadcasting signals from a radio or television station. Occasionally we hear about things like “pirate radio” and “pirate TV.”59 In the
172

HOMO VIDENS

popular imagination, these operations are run by radicals shacked up in
secret locations with primitive equipment. Said radicals “appropriate”
bandwidth from “the man” and therewith broadcast their scratchy radicalism to the masses yearning to be free (or listen to weird music). It’s
all very outré. It’s also very risky business because the authorities – the
folks who license the airwaves – usually have no difﬁculty locating and
closing down the pirate operations. Actually, pretty much anyone with
a radio direction ﬁnder – not a complicated or expensive piece of equipment – can make their way to the source of a radio or television signal.
Once they ﬁnd the source, they are going to ﬁnd you, and your “cover”
is going to be blown. So you can’t hide your identity very easily in the
world of broadcast. But can you hide your message, that is, transmit it
to a closed audience? You only have two options for accomplishing this
feat: limiting reception and limiting comprehension. There is no way to
do the former while broadcasting: anyone with the proper equipment
can pick up an airborne signal. You can, however, constrain reception
by transmitting your signal over a closed circuit; that way only those “in
the loop” will be able to receive it. But this won’t really work for a large
network because it will have too many loose ends to monitor. Someone
will hack in. As for limiting comprehension, this can be accomplished
by encrypting your signal whether you broadcast it or send it over a
closed circuit. If you have the cipher, you can decode the signal. If not,
then not. Again, this won’t work well on a large network because too
many people will have the cipher to secure it properly. Somebody will
leak it. All this talk of closed circuits and codes may sound far removed
from your humdrum life, but it’s not. If you have cable TV, you are
both on a closed circuit and have a decoder. If you aren’t paying for
your cable TV, then you have joined the millions of viewers who have
hacked through both.
On the receive side, it’s entirely possible for someone to tell whether
you are listening to the radio or watching TV in the “privacy” of your
own home. Both kinds of receivers give off signals that can be detected
through walls and from some distance. Just ask anyone who lives in
Britain. The United Kingdom sells annual licenses to the owners of TV
sets in order to fund the BBC. These licenses aren’t cheap: £142.50
for a color TV and £48.00 for a black-and-white one.60 Naturally,
some people don’t pay, or at least try not to. So the TV Licensing
ofﬁce (TVL) has a ﬂeet of unmarked vans with ultra-secret detection
173

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

equipment that roam the streets looking for what might be called
“TV pirates.” According to a TVL spokesperson, the vans are “so
powerful they can tell if a TV is in use in as little as 20 seconds. And
once the television is detected, the equipment – which works from up to
60 meters away – can pinpoint the actual room that the television set is
in.”61 The TVL catches over 400,000 “TV pirates” a year, though how
many are caught with the vans is not certain. If this sort of equipment
is commonly used in a democratic state like the United Kingdom, one
can only imagine that it was and probably is used in despotic governments as well. The rulers of the former Eastern Bloc, as well as those of
contemporary China, Iran, and Cuba, don’t want their subjects being
“corrupted” by foreign broadcasts. In June 2008, a street vendor in
Zimbabwe, then ruled by the tyrant Robert Mugabe, was arrested for
listening to the Voice of America.62 All this may sound a bit like something ripped from the pages of Orwell’s 1984, but the reality is quite
different. In most of the world, governments make no attempt at all
to monitor or control what people listen to or watch in their homes,
and those that do try to surveil and limit radio and TV use have failed.
Although it’s really impossible to know for certain, there is good reason
to believe that tens of millions of East German subjects tuned in to West
German radio and TV daily.63 Penetration was also high in the remaining Eastern Bloc countries, including the USSR.64 Although the Chinese
government has not entirely given up on radio and TV censorship, it
has certainly loosened its grip (or rather, had it loosened by increasing
public demand for foreign broadcasts).65 Satellite dishes are illegal in
Iran, but many people seem to have and use them.66 Only the North
Koreans have had real success in controlling what their subjects listen to
and watch. Every “Hermit Kingdom” brand radio and television comes
conveniently and permanently preset to government stations and sealed
to prevent tampering.67 In North Korea, the TV watches you.
So you won’t be able to broadcast audiovisual signals without
“revealing your position,” but you will probably be able to privately
listen to or watch whatever you like from the comfort of your pleather
Barcalounger. Here again we encounter a dual network. Audiovisual
networks are connected on the send side: the senders are few, known
to one another, and constitute a coherent group. In contrast, they are
segmented on the receive side: recipients are very many, not known to
one other, and are clustered into “audiences.” Our theory has it that
174

HOMO VIDENS

such networks will simultaneously open social practices on the send side
due to the practical impossibility of hiding transmission and close them
on the receive side due to the ease with which reception can be hidden.
Both opening and closing are apparent in the history of societies that
have adopted audiovisual technologies.
From almost the very beginning of audiovisual media, broadcasters
had no choice but to operate in the open. As we’ve seen, American media
companies in all three spheres – movies, radio, and TV – quickly grew,
consolidated, and became nationwide and later worldwide brands. Just
as quickly they came under intense public scrutiny.68 After repeated
calls for state censorship, the movie industry created the Motion Picture
Producers and Distributors of America in 1922 and instituted the selflimiting Production Code in 1930. Radio and TV were not as successful in fending off state regulation, largely because of the federal government’s nationalization of precious bandwidth. The Federal Radio
Commission was created in 1927 with the right to assign frequencies
and issue broadcast licenses as it pleased. In 1934, it was renamed the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Under the watchful eye
of the FCC, not to mention the press and the public, the audiovisual
industry quickly came to dominate American national consciousness
in a way no one could have imagined. Amazingly, the exploits of its
gray-suited executives – Samuel Goldwyn, Louis B. Mayer, David O.
Selznik, Darryl Zanuck, Howard Hughes, Walt Disney, David Sarnoff,
William Paley, Barry Diller – became objects of public fascination. The
personal lives of its stars, far too numerous and well-known to mention
here, were followed by millions with an intensity bordering on mania.
The case was much the same, if somewhat more muted, in countries
that heavily subsidized or nationalized the ﬁlm, radio, and TV industries. Even tyrannies got into the act. Their ministries of culture created
auteur-directors, national stars, and lavish (if often kitschy and propagandistic) productions of every kind. The North Korean despot Kim
Jong-il liked movies so much that he kidnapped a famous South Korean
director, Shin San-ok, and ordered him to make ﬁlms for the beneﬁt of
the hard-working, long-suffering people of North Korea.69 He made
seven movies, with the Dear Leader serving as executive producer of
each.
That was the “is” of the situation: broadcast audiovisual production
and distribution were open, public affairs. The “ought” took the form
175

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

of a new publicism according to which movies, radio, and TV were
believed to be public or quasi-public property. Whether they were held
by private companies as in the United States, or by the state as in much
of Europe, the broadcast media were seen as somehow beholden to
“the people” because they were intrinsically public on the send side.
In contrast to writing and print, broadcasts could not be hidden. That
meant they could be regulated. Politicians, pundits, and concerned citizens argued that they should be. They claimed that regulation would,
variously, save children, educate the public, protect decency, promote
culture, preserve neutrality, limit commercialism, and so on and so
forth. But all of these reasons boiled down to the belief that the broadcast audiovisual media were shared resources, something that belongs
to everyone. The public does not own writing or print, but it does own
the airwaves.70
In contrast, consumption of audiovisual media began as a quasipublic affair and became more private and closed as the century progressed. The original nickelodeons and movie palaces were public places
where crowds of people went to watch in public.71 Similarly, early
radio (1920s) and TV (1940s) were enjoyed in public settings, though
they were generally smaller than those at movie houses.72 Even in the
ﬁrst years of audiovisual media, however, entrepreneurs realized that
there was a sizable market in private viewing. As early as the 1890s,
movie makers were producing proto-pornographic shorts to be viewed
in single-viewer Mutoscopes and Kinetoscopes. Soon they were doing a
thriving (if clandestine) trade in coin-in-the-slot peep shows and “stag
ﬁlms.”73 The privatization of audiovisual consumption, however, didn’t
really take off until mid-century, when two crucial developments took
place. First, automobile manufacturers began to put radios in cars and
cars themselves became ubiquitous.74 Although we don’t usually think
of it, the car is one of the few places one can truly be alone without
drawing attention to the fact that one is alone. No one is put off when
you go for a drive by yourself. And since you are riding solo, you might
as well listen to the radio. Second, television manufacturers began to
produce TVs every homeowner could afford.75 Thus, the “TV room”
found its place in every middle-class house.76 Although the TV room
was not a place to be alone (that would be suspicious), it was a locus
where the family could gather in private around the “electronic hearth.”

176

HOMO VIDENS

In the 1970s, the notion that every member of the family should have
his or her “own space” and hence own room further privatized the
consumption of audiovisual media. When everyone has their own TV,
there is no ﬁghting over the remote control (or “dominator” as it’s
sometimes rightly called). The ﬁnal moment in audiovisual privatization came with the Walkman and the videotape.77 With the former, you
could listen to your music in your private space whether you happened
to be alone or not. With the latter – which was much more culturally
signiﬁcant in the long term – you could order anything you liked anonymously and, with the right equipment and a private space, view it alone.
Naturally, this was a boon to pornographers, whose business had long
suffered under the logistical requirement that they sell their wares in
public.78 The days of stealing into the dirty movie theater were over.
All you had to do in the age of the videotape was get a post ofﬁce box
and ﬁll out a form. As we’ve seen, no prude or politician was likely to
try to stop you, and even if they did, they would probably fail.
That was the “is” of the situation: people were going to listen to and
watch what they wanted in the privacy of their own homes. The concomitant “ought” added additional weight to already well-established
Print-Era doctrines such as the “right to privacy,” the “harm principle,”
“obligatory tolerance,” and “aesthetic populism.” Whether you were a
citizen of the Soviet Union or the United States, you were more or less
formally free to listen to or watch whatever you wanted in your own
home. Yet this was not much of a concession on the part of the aforementioned regulators, for practically speaking you could only listen to
or watch what the broadcasters broadcasted, which is to say what the
regulators wanted you to hear or see. If you fancied something else,
you were free to record it or ﬁlm it within the conﬁnes of the law. But
of course you couldn’t do that very easily. And it goes without saying
that you couldn’t distribute your music or ﬁlm even if you managed to
produce it because then you would be subject to regulation. The advent
of non-broadcast audiovisual media – especially videotape and cable –
presented the regulators with a problem, as they could be produced,
distributed, and consumed in private. After attempting to control this
new audiovisual channel for a time, the regulators either disappeared, as
in the case of the Soviet Union, or gave up, as in the case of most of the
liberal democracies. Thus, in the second half of the twentieth century,

177

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

it became both legal and acceptable to consume, for example, audiovisual pornography so long as it didn’t travel through the “public’s”
airwaves.
Fidelity

In 1824, the famous German historian Leopold von Ranke enjoined his
colleagues to represent the past “as it really was.”79 Alas, neither he
nor is colleagues had the right tool for the job. They wrote, and written
words are a poor way to represent anything other than themselves. As
we’ve said, the word “daisy” looks like the word “daisy,” but it doesn’t
look like a daisy. In this regard, audiovisual media are different. They
don’t appear to be representations of anything. Rather, they seem to
be experience itself. This sense is reﬂected in the way we speak. We
“read” written or printed texts, and they are the only things that can
really be read. But we “listen” to recorded music just as we would
listen to live music, and we “watch” recorded moving pictures just
the way we watch life go by. Reading text seems unnatural. Listening
to and watching recorded audiovisual media seem natural. Of course,
from a purely technical standpoint, both are unnatural insofar as both
are encoded signals. The difference is that you must laboriously learn
to decipher the code to understand a text, while you just “get” the
audiovisual code without conscious effort. The reason we automatically
“get” audiovisual code is that it’s iconic. Written and printed words are
symbolic.80 They don’t appear like anything but words. Their only use
is to “stand for” something other than themselves. But a recorded voice
sounds like a natural voice. A photographed image looks like a natural
image. They don’t seem to “stand for” something, they appear to be
something.
This is to say that audiovisual media don’t reduce sense data to an
obtrusive code. Rather, they “capture” it for playback, and in this sense
they are really best thought of as one-to-one codes. Sound-recording
media encode sound for playback as sound. Visual-recording media
encode vision for playback as vision. Now in principle, audiovisual
media can be used as ﬁve-to-one codes, just like writing and print. The
results of such use, however, are often hard to “get.” Ferde Grofé’s
“Grand Canyon Suite” may somehow sound like the Grand Canyon
looks, but you just don’t “get” the reference the way you do when
178

HOMO VIDENS

you look at a picture of the Grand Canyon. “Purple Haze” is not purple, “More than a Feeling” is not a feeling, “Smells Like Teen Spirit”
doesn’t smell like anything, and “A Taste of Honey,” were you to take
a bite of the 1963 Beatles’ album on which it appeared, would taste
like old vinyl. These things sound like something, namely themselves.
We should add one detail about audiovisual media: like print, they can
be reproduced easily and accurately in very large numbers at very low
cost. “Reproduced” is surely the right word for audiovisual recordings
like records, ﬁlms, tapes, CDs, and DVDs, for these things are copied.
Whether one should call a broadcast received by a radio or television
a “reproduction” is rather a sticky philosophical point. It’s clear, however, that the sounds and sights audiovisual transmitters transmit travel
through space and then appear in many different places at the same
time. Given this fact, it makes at least some sense to say that the transmitted item is an “original” and the received versions “copies,” albeit
evanescent unless recorded.
Audiovisual media, then, are very high ﬁdelity, at least in the audio
and visual channels: what goes in comes out the same way. High-ﬁdelity
media create iconic networks, that is, ones that carry messages that
require little or no effort to decode. Iconic audio and visual signals
are not “read” but “recognized,” not “deciphered” but “experienced.”
According to our theory, iconic networks sensualize social practices
developed in or around them. Humans naturally seek sensual pleasure,
but in ordinary circumstances their pleasure-seeking drive is blunted
by high costs. Iconic networks lower the cost of seeking and receiving
sensual pleasures of certain kinds, thereby leading to sensualization of
social practices and mores.
Sensualization is one of the hallmarks of modern life, both in the
institutional and moral sense. To be sure, Manuscript and Print Cultures had their pleasure palaces. These included brothels, public houses,
gentlemen’s clubs, not to mention a calendar full of riotous, drunken,
and often bawdy festivals. But in most cases their “entertainments”
were not mediated. Prostitutes, publicans, club managers, and carnival
masters ran what consultants sometimes call “high-touch” businesses.
Everything is done face-to-face, and a premium is put on personal –
sometimes very personal – relationships. This fact necessarily limited
market size: a high-touch service provider can only provide so many
services without a drastic reduction in the quality of the “product.”
179

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

For this reason, high-touch services tended to be expensive, and so
might be called “costly thrills.” In the Manuscript and Print Eras there
was only one way to radically reduce the cost of costly thrills – theater.
Entrepreneurs took personal, sensual services and made “live” representations of them that could be shown to many people at the same
time. The representation wasn’t as good as the real thing, but from the
perspective of the punters it was cheap and reasonably safe. For a few
pennies you could see a man tame a lion without risking getting eaten.
Theater proved popular, but it still suffered from two drawbacks. First,
only so many people could watch. The Romans’ fabled Circus Maximus could hold several hundred thousand people.81 That’s a lot, but
one wonders exactly what the poor folks in the cheap seats really saw.
Remember, neither the Romans nor anyone else had PA systems or JumboTrons. The larger the audience, the less you saw; the less you saw,
the less sensual the experience. Second, the authorities had good reason
to be worried about theater, and so they restricted it. The moralists
among them, like Plato, didn’t like what was shown. The rulers among
them didn’t like the threat they posed to public order.82 From a ruler’s
perspective, the difference between a rowdy audience and a rebellious
mob can be subtle. For all these reasons, cheap, vicarious thrills were
hard to come by in the Manuscript and Print Eras.
Audiovisual media changed all that. By making iconic sound and
sight portable, audiovisual media – or rather that part of it known as the
“entertainment industry”83 – made high-touch businesses low-touch. In
the audiovisual world, the stimulator no longer had to be in the physical
presence of the stimulated. This separation revolutionized the sensation
industry by radically reducing the risks associated with sending and
receiving sensual signals. This is true in a physical sense: sex workers
can rip off johns, and johns can beat up sex workers, but neither can
harm the other directly in an interaction mediated by a pornographic
ﬁlm. But it’s also true in a psychological sense: people will do things
and watch things “alone” that they would never do or watch in public
for fear of embarrassment. Not only did audiovisual media make the
exchange of stimulation safe, it also made it remarkably inexpensive.
Neither high-touch sensual services like prostitution nor low-touch sensual services like live theater could be mechanically reproduced; therefore, they remained comparatively expensive and undemocratic. They
were, as we said, costly thrills. In contrast, audiovisual media could be
180

HOMO VIDENS

mechanically duplicated and so became inexpensive and democratic.
They engendered the ﬁrst “cheap thrills.” In the Manuscript and Print
Eras, hundreds of well-born people occasionally watched plays in public amphitheaters. In the Audiovisual Era, billions of common people
constantly watch TV in their own homes. They aren’t watching plays,
but other quasi-sensual, dramatic material: romances, thrillers, comedies, talk shows, fashion shows, cooking shows, and sports of every
variety. They cannot and will not stop because it feels too good.
That was the “is” of the situation: people were going to stimulate
themselves with audiovisual media. The “ought” needed to justify selfstimulation was not immediately obvious. Written and print signals
are often constitutionally protected speech; broadcast audiovisual signals usually are not. Therefore, a “freedom of expression” rationale
wouldn’t work. You have the right to consume any written or print
signal in private; so too do you have the right to consume any broadcast audiovisual signal in private. So “right to privacy” and related
justiﬁcations would work in principle. But there was a hitch: many
audiovisual signals were either intrinsically public (broadcast radio and
TV) or hard to make completely private (recorded music and videos).
Thus, other people were going to know what you were listening to or
watching, and therefore you would be open to public censure if you
listened to or watched the wrong things. Clearly, the only option was
to change the criteria for what the wrong things were. That was accomplished by expanding the notion of Romanticism. The late eighteenthand nineteenth-century Romantics had hammered out the idea that it
was ﬁne to feel, and that things that made you feel more were ﬁne
as well. Most of them had poetry, paintings, and opium in mind. The
postwar Romantics of the Audiovisual Era went further. Frank Sinatra,
Hugh Hefner, Aldous Huxley, among others created what might be
called “Softcore Romanticism,” that is, a way of life built around the
night club, mild eroticism, and “mind-expanding” drugs.84 It was very
sophisticated and therefore could be consumed in public. In turn, their
successors – Sid Vicious, Larry Flint, and William Burroughs, et al. –
went even further. They founded “Hardcore Romanticism,” a cultural
style built on hard-core music, hard-core pornography, and hard-core
drugs.85 It wasn’t sophisticated. Rather, it was “intense,” which is to
say very stimulating. And since everything stimulating was good, it too
could be consumed in the open.
181

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

Volume

An intuitive way to measure the volume that speech, writing, and printing can sustain is to ﬁnd the number of words in a typical message and
then multiply it by the number of recipients. With this simple method
we reached the sensible conclusion that speech and writing, neither of
which can be mass-reproduced, were low volume, while printing, which
can, was high volume. This formula, alas, won’t work terribly well for
audiovisual media because their “content” is not limited to words.
In addition to words, they truck in sounds and images. Sounds and
images can’t really be counted, at least very easily. One could reckon
the bits and bytes typical audiovisual messages contain, but that ﬁgure
doesn’t really yield a good approximation of the quantity of information received by the listener or viewer. A highly compressed, small
digital sound ﬁle can sound as good as an uncompressed, very large
digital sound ﬁle – it all depends on the compression software and the
sensitivity of the listener.
Since audiovisual messages ﬂow past the passive consumer in time,
duration might provide a logical metric for message size. The longest
“song” regularly broadcast is probably Mahler’s Symphony No. 3,
coming in at 110 minutes; the shortest is the grind-core band Napalm
Death’s “You Suffer,” coming in at 1.316 seconds.86 The longest movie
ever shown in theaters is the German ﬁlm Heimat II, which runs
25 hours and 32 minutes; the shortest is called The One Second Film.87
The longest continuous radio segment was hosted by Switzerland’s
Christoph Stöckli and lasted 105 hours; the shortest was a commercial that ran under a second for none other than The Guinness Book
of World Records.88 The longest continuous TV segment was hosted
by Croatia’s Kristijan Petrovic and ran 36 hours and 15 minutes; the
shortest TV segment was a commercial that ran one-sixtieth of a second
for a Canadian music retailer.89 All this is interesting, but not really
very enlightening because audiovisual messages – particularly those
that are broadcast – don’t really come in discrete packages like spoken “speeches,” written “letters,” and printed “books.” Rather, they
stream 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, year in and year out. In that
sense, the longest audiovisual messages have been running and will be
running for decades. Nobody listens to or watches them continuously.
The longest anyone has ever watched TV at a stretch was 69 hours and
182

HOMO VIDENS

48 minutes. This feat was accomplished by Suresh Joachim during a
stunt staged by – that’s right – a TV program, the Live with Regis and
Kelly Show.90 In 2006, the average American household watched TV
for 8 hours and 14 minutes a day, though the average American only
watched for 4 hours and 35 minutes.91 Still, the signal was always there,
incessantly piping audiovisual information into millions of homes.
Perhaps a better way to judge the capacity of the audiovisual pipe
is by counting “channels,” that is, streams of more-or-less continuous sonic and visual output that reach – or can reach – some considerable number of people. In the beginning, these were few and had
relatively short range. Around 1900, records and phonographs were
uncommon, movies and movies theaters were rare, and there was no
commercial radio or television. By the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst century,
all of these media ﬂowed through multiple channels, many of which
reached millions of people. The number of devices, albums, movies,
radio stations, TV stations, and now video games available is astounding. There are now in use in the world today hundreds of millions of
machines that play back sound, and billions of things (records, tapes,
CDs) to play back on them. In a bit over ﬁve years, Apple has sold
100 million iPods, and its iTunes music store has sold in excess of 2.5
billion songs. Both numbers are rising.92 In 2007, the people of the
United States bought 500 million albums (records, tapes, CDs), though
that number is declining due to music piracy and online sales.93 The
number of movie screens worldwide is enormous and hard to ﬁgure.
According to the annual statistical report of the Cahiers du cinema, the
United States had 38,974 screens, Europe had 25,028 screens, and India
had 14,000 screens in 2007.94 The world total probably approaches
150,000 screens. There’s a lot to be seen on them. According to the
same source, India produced 1,146 ﬁlms, Europe 1,095 ﬁlms, and the
United States 603 ﬁlms in 2007.95 The world total would seem to
be around 5,000 ﬁlms. The number of radio stations in the world
is not known but doubtless very large. In 2006, there were about
1,400 licensed broadcast stations in the United States.96 Urban markets in the developed world commonly have several dozen stations.
The number of television stations in the world is not known but,
again, doubtless sizable. In 2006, there were approximately 2,200 in the
United States.97 The average home in the United States receives 118 TV
channels.98
183

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

Audiovisual media, then, clearly are very high volume. They deliver
millions of messages, long and short, continuously ﬂowing through
thousands of channels to billions of listeners and viewers. As new
technologies come online – particularly ﬁber-optic cable and nextgeneration satellites – they will have the capacity to deliver even more
messages through more channels to more people. High-volume media
engender unconstrained networks, that is, ones with a lot of spare capacity. Audiovisual networks ﬁt the bill not only because the audiovisual
pipe is enormous, but also because it is only one of four pipes. When
audiovisual media came into existence, speech, writing, and especially
print already provided considerable bandwidth to senders and recipients. Together, this aggregate “legacy” pipe offered all the volume
needed to perform high-value, necessary communications work and
more. Audiovisual media provided even more spare capacity, a ﬂood of
cheap bandwidth that could be used as senders and recipients saw ﬁt. In
our theory, unconstrained networks like those created by audiovisual
media hedonize social practices developed in and around them. They
do this precisely by affording people the opportunity to use the medium
for the purposes of entertainment at low cost. Like no other medium
before, audiovisual media provided this opportunity.
The results were dramatic, as the history of entertainment in the
twentieth century shows. In Manuscript Cultures, most of your time
was consumed by family life and work, and most of the communication you did was related to those two spheres. This situation changed
somewhat with the coming of industry and the advent of mass print.
The former raised living standards, reduced working hours, and created the opportunity for what we now call “leisure,” a new sort of
structured, sanctioned activity. The latter gave people something to do
in it, namely read for pleasure. But that wasn’t all people in the nineteenth century did with their leisure time. Entrepreneurs realized that
additional brass in pocket and time on hand created commercial opportunities for those who might provide safe, accessible, and sometimes
clean amusements. Thus was the “live” entertainment industry born.
Businessmen expanded theaters, created music halls, and opened seaside resorts, all of which became very popular in the Victorian era. But
it wasn’t enough. There was still plenty of excess demand for entertainments, especially inexpensive ones that could be consumed quickly and
conveniently. The recorded music, ﬁlm, radio, and TV industries were
184

HOMO VIDENS

all born of this excess, unmet demand.99 Technicians such as Bell, Edison, Westinghouse, Tesla, Marconi, Fessenden, Zworykin, Farnsworth,
and the rest all understood the commercial potential of audiovisual
media. They knew people wanted to listen and watch. They actively
sought patents and ﬁnancial backing so that their technological innovations (one can’t really in most cases call them “inventions”) could
be commercialized. As we’ve already pointed out, the men who did the
commercialization are household names, as are the companies they ran:
Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, Disney, RCA, NBC, CBS, ABC
and so on. The Berliners, Goldwyns, and Sarnoffs laid the audiovisual
pipe and simultaneously produced entertainment to ﬂow through it.
The result was an explosion of cultural production the likes of which
the world had never seen. Thousands of singers, musicians, writers,
actors, and technicians of every kind were trained and put to work
feeding the pipe. They produced thousands upon thousands of songs,
movies, radio shows, and programs. As they did, demand rose with
standards of living. By the mid-twentieth century, daily life in the
developed world had been transformed. You no longer had to “make
your own fun.” Now you bought it or – even better – it was given
to you for the price of watching a few silly advertisements. Playing
recorded music, going to ﬁlms, listening to the radio, and watching
TV became things that literally everyone did for several hours or more
each day.100
That was the “is” of the situation: people were going to have their
MTV no matter what. The “ought” devised to rationalize audiovisual
hedonism had to be different from that rolled out for literary hedonism: almost no one seems to be able to stomach the idea that pop
music, porno ﬁlms, and trash TV are, like reading, modes of “selfimprovement.”101 This is not to say that critics said all of it was bad
for you. On the contrary, they claimed some high-brow audiovisual
entertainment – Bach records, French art ﬁlms, BBC costume dramas –
could be edifying.102 But most of it was deemed garbage, the aural and
visual equivalent of junk food. People, however, really like junk food,
so some pretext for eating it (or rather, listening to and watching it) had
to be found. This wasn’t difﬁcult. Even before Freud, psychologists had
said that modern life was unnaturally stressful and, thus, that a period
of daily relaxation was necessary for good mental health.103 The audiovisual industry was ready and able to step up and help by providing
185

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

many hours of relaxing sounds and sights for the stressed-out worker.
Of course, said worker could quietly meditate, but – so the argument
went – watching TV for three hours accomplishes the same thing and
is much more entertaining. The downside is that stimulation of the
relaxing sort, so to speak, can be addictive, but no matter.104
Velocity

In 1964, the legendary Canadian animator Richard Williams began
making a movie called The Thief and the Cobbler.105 He worked on it
and then didn’t. He got funding, then lost it. He landed a distribution
deal and then that slipped away. At one point, The Thief and the Cobbler was seized by creditors. In 1995, the ﬁlm was ﬁnally released in
the United States under the title Arabian Knight. The new name didn’t
help. It ﬂopped. Thirty-one years is a long time, much longer than it
takes to produce most ﬁlms. But the case of The Thief and the Cobbler
is proof that audiovisual messages are not made overnight. Most aren’t
even made over many nights. Feature ﬁlms can take decades to produce,
albums can take years, radio shows months, and TV shows equally as
long. That’s part of the reason you hear about them (and hear about
them and hear about them) well before they appear. With some effort,
audiovisual messages can be put together quickly, sometimes with surprisingly good results. Roger Corman’s cult comedy The Little Shop of
Horrors (1960) was shot in two days.106 The Beatles recorded most of
their debut album Please Please Me (1962) in about 10 hours.107 But
generally speaking, professional-quality audiovisual messages can’t be
fashioned that fast. You might think that “live” broadcasts – ones in
which performance and transmission are simultaneous – are an exception. They aren’t. Most of them take extensive preparation – rehearsals –
before they are “ready for primetime.” The fact is, you just aren’t very
likely to ﬁnd anything “spontaneous” on live radio or TV, unless you are
listening to the college radio station or watching the local public access
channel. From the perspective of audiovisual executives, departing from
the script is dangerous. From the perspective of consumers, it’s usually
just bad. Although the production of audiovisual messages is slow, some
of them move very quickly. Those recorded on portable media don’t:
movies, videos, tapes, and CDs have to be physically moved from wherever they were made to wherever you are. If the means of transportation
186

HOMO VIDENS

are good, then they will arrive quickly. If not, then you will wait. But
the others move like lightning. Like all electromagnetic waves, radio
and TV signals in a vacuum travel at close to the speed of light, that is,
186,000 miles per second.108 Coaxial and ﬁber-optic cable propagates
electromagnetic waves at over 110,000 miles per second.109
Despite their remarkable transmission speed, audiovisual media are
low velocity because they take a long time to produce, at least the way
we generally like them produced. Low-velocity media engender monologic networks, that is, networks in which it is relatively easy to send
information, but not easy to respond, especially in medium-kind. If
Lush Rimbaugh or some other blowhard says something you don’t like
on the radio or TV, you might call the station and vent. It is unlikely,
however, that you will try to mount a radio or TV show called “Lush
Rimbaugh is a Very Corpulent Buffoon” for the sole purpose of blasting Rimbaugh off the air. That would take a long time, not to mention
a lot of money. By the date you got the show ready and issued your
scorching rebuttal, no one would really remember what you were on
about. In the real world of audiovisual media, Rimbaugh lectures you
and you don’t get to lecture him back. Rimbaugh’s bête noire, Foul
Rankin, can respond in kind because he has a production company at
his disposal (or at least he used to). But he’s not going to be able to ﬁre
back immediately. The wheels of audiovisual production, as we said,
grind slowly. He’s going to have to run the idea by the producer, get
the writers to work on it, ﬁt it into the already-ﬁlled schedule, and then
tape it. That might take a day, or it might take a week. The result will
not exactly be a face-off between Rimbaugh and Rankin, but instead,
two monologues separated by a considerable period of time, the second of which makes extensive reference to the ﬁrst. This is why albums
don’t generally respond to albums, movies to movies, radio shows to
radio shows, and TV shows to TV shows or really any of these media
to each other – they are just too slow to make the “dialogue” apparent, except to acolytes, aesthetes, and academics who make a game of
searching out “homage.” By our theory, monologic networks like those
engendered by audiovisual media centralize social practices evolved in
and around them. These networks suppress the natural human inclination to engage in dialogue and impose on it one-way communications –
information ﬂows from one node to another (or many others), but not
back.
187

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

Written networks such as those characteristic of Manuscript Culture
were essentially monologic: elites used writing to communicate to other
elites and the unlettered masses. There was little written dialogue to
speak of because writing was too slow and too rare to sustain it. After
1450, print networks – also monologic – either replaced or were added
to existing written networks. There was still no real dialogue, although
the number and size of monologic networks expanded appreciably, the
consequence of which was the birth of the public sphere. The coming of
audiovisual media in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century had much the
same impact as print. There was still no dialogue, but the number and
especially size of monologic networks grew. We can see this clearly in the
experience of the United States. The motion picture networks were ﬁrst.
Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and the rest produced pictures for
distribution to chains of movie houses that they often owned. The radio
networks were next. NBC, CBS, and ABC produced radio programming
for distribution in stations they owned or were afﬁliated with. Then
there were the television networks. NBC, CBS, and ABC used their
experience in radio and accumulated capital to create TV networks,
and produced shows for their own and afﬁliate stations. Beginning in
the 1970s, the growth of cable and satellite transmission brought a
further expansion in the number of networks. Counting both TV and
radio, these now number in the hundreds in the United States. If the
primary result of the spread of print-based monologic networks was
the emergence of the public sphere, that of the rise of audiovisualbased monologic counterparts was the appearance of what might be
called the “entertainment sphere.” Its structure is like that of the public
sphere in that a relatively small set of strong nodes send messages to
very large sets of weak nodes, who cannot respond in kind (or often
at all). The difference is rather in content than form: communications
in the public sphere tend to be a means to an end, whereas those in
the entertainment sphere tend to be an end in themselves. We read
the newspaper because we think we should in order to become better
citizens (or some such). We watch TV because we enjoy it, full stop.
Newspaper editors give you homework assignments; TV producers give
you games to play during recess. In both cases, however, it’s important
to recognize that the activity is structured by the shape of the network:
the editors and producers “speak” to you; you don’t get to “talk back,”
at least directly.
188

HOMO VIDENS

That was the “is” of the situation: broadcasters would broadcast
and recipients would receive. The “ought” needed to justify this lack
of dialogue was already at hand, namely, a form of dictatorism that
dictated some should rightfully speak for (or to) others. The Print Era
had evolved this doctrine to deal with the concentration of presses in the
hands of a relative few. The Audiovisual Era pushed it further to deal
with the concentration of broadcast media in the hands of a relative
fewer. Again we have two versions: the liberal one, under which those
who speak through the audiovisual media are somehow winners in the
“marketplace of ideas,” and the illiberal one, under which those who
speak through the audiovisual media know the Truth. Interestingly,
in both cases the ﬁction of popular control is maintained: in liberal
democracies, the “people” vote with their dollars and attention; in
socialist one-party states, the “people” and the Vanguard Party are one
and the same.
Range

Electromagnetic waves, including radio and TV signals, can travel a
long way. Astronomers have detected infrared EM waves from celestial bodies 13.2 billion light-years from our sun.110 The space probe
Voyager I regularly sends super-high-frequency EM signals more than
10 billion miles back to earth.111 They take 14 hours to get here. EM
waves travel through space so well because they move in a straight
line and nothing much gets in their way. The earth, however, is curved
and covered with a soupy atmosphere, meaning that terrestrial EM
broadcast won’t travel as far. Still, if you have the right tools and some
know-how, you can exchange them at considerable distance. “DXers” –
enthusiasts who make a sport of pulling in distant radio and TV signals – can tune in stations thousands of miles away in good conditions.
The signals bounce off the ionosphere and back down to earth, where
the DXers pick them up with very sensitive equipment. Most people
don’t have this sort of equipment, but then again they don’t need it.
Good commercial broadcast stations can transmit signals between 10
and 50 miles, and any commercial radio and television can tune them in.
But if you want to get radio from Australia or television from Taiwan,
you can. You just need to buy a satellite dish or get cable and you’ll
get feeds from every part of the globe. We hardly need to point out
that everyone within range – which is everyone – who has the proper
189

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

equipment – which is not everyone, but most people – can receive a
“copy” of whatever is being transmitted. That means enormous audiences, particularly for single events. On September 9, 1956, an estimated
60 million people tuned in to see Elvis Presley shake, rattle, and roll on
The Ed Sullivan Show.112 On September 26, 1960, a reported 75 million viewers watched the Nixon and Kennedy presidential debate.113 On
July 20, 1969, something on the order of 600 million people tuned in to
see Neil Armstrong make one giant leap for mankind.114 On September
6, 1997, a remarkable 2.5 billion people apparently watched some of
Princess Diana’s funeral.115 Periodic events, like the Super Bowl and
World Cup games, routinely gather audiences between 50 million and
100 million.116 Primetime shows draw millions daily.117
Audiovisual media, then, has long range and great reach. Under the
right conditions, speech can reach hundreds of people, manuscriptwriting thousands, and print hundreds of thousands. Audiovisual
media, however, reach many millions of people scattered all over the
globe as a matter of course. Media such as these engender extensive
networks, that is, networks in which information is passed over great
distances and through large populations. We proposed that extensive
networks would diversify social practices and the values accompanying them. Geographically large and demographically inclusive networks
promote interaction among strangers more readily than those that are
small and monochrome. Populations mix, and as a result both institutions and worldviews become diverse, or at least tolerant of diversity.
Diversiﬁcation is everywhere apparent in the Audiovisual Era. In
the Speech and Manuscript Eras, people’s knowledge was more or less
conﬁned to what they experienced in their own daily lives, which were
almost always narrow. You knew your people and what they did. What
others did, you could not know. Print broadened people’s horizons to
some degree by bringing them “foreign” experiences to read. You had
never hunted sperm whales in the Atlantic, traveled by caravan over the
Silk Road, or had tea with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. But you
could read about doing all these things from people who had, or at least
could convincingly pretend they had. As a diversifying agent, however,
print had drawbacks: it was comparatively difﬁcult to distribute, not
everyone could decode it, and there were many different and mutually
unintelligible codes. Print’s reach, therefore, was limited. Not so audiovisual media. They truly “democratized” experience.”118 Radio and TV
190

HOMO VIDENS

could be beamed anywhere: physical transportation was in most cases
unnecessary. Anyone could “get” it: you didn’t have to learn the code
because you already knew it. And the cultural barrier was low: the
visual code was universal, and the audio code often unnecessary for
enjoyment. Audiovisual media brought whaling, caravanning, high tea,
and everything else anyone had ever experienced or imagined experiencing to the masses at a cost they could bear and in a language they could
understand. With audiovisual media, you could really “see” the world
and never leave your couch. Of course, all of your experiences would
be vicarious. But what did it matter? Real experiences were expensive,
uncomfortable, and often boring. Audiovisual experiences were always
cheap, unthreatening, and carefully chosen precisely for excitement.
That was the “is” of the situation: the audiovisual media allowed
people to trade experiences and therefore broaden their experiential
horizons in a way previously unimaginable. The “ought” developed to
legitimate this mixing and expansion was a new form of pluralism that
generally goes by the name “multiculturalism.”119 Multiculturalism is
essentially the Print Era’s doctrine of toleration adapted for a new media
ecology. Both share the central notion that there are no “strangers” in
the sense of unclassiﬁable people or things. We and everything around us
are “us” or “them.” But there are subtle differences. Toleration emphasized the similarity of “us” and “them”; multiculturalism stresses the
differences. Toleration looked forward to a point at which people, however different to begin with, might become one; multiculturalism insists
on preserving “diversity” now and forever. Toleration was premised on
a qualiﬁed acceptance of behaviors; multiculturalism’s permissiveness
is nearly unbounded.
Persistence

Here are some remarkable facts. You can see one of the ﬁrst photographs ever taken, a “heliograph” of a Dutch engraving – that is, a
picture of a picture – produced by Nicéphore Niépce in 1825.120 You
can listen to one of the ﬁrst sound recordings, a “phonautograph” of
a French folk song produced by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville in
1860.121 You can watch one of the earliest silent ﬁlms, the so-called
Roundhay Garden Scene produced by Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince
in 1888.122 You can enjoy one of the earliest “talking pictures,” Lee De
191

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

Forest’s “phonoﬁlm” of a barking dog of 1921.123 You can listen to
one of the ﬁrst radio broadcasts, Frank L. Capp’s recording of President
Woodrow Wilson’s Armistice Day Speech in 1923.124 You can watch
the ﬁrst recorded TV signal, a shot of a dummy taken by the Scottish
inventor John Logie Baird in 1927.125
In the last chapter, we noted that the longevity of any manuscript is a
function of substrate, script, and language. The persistence of audiovisual media is also determined by only three factors: the medium in which
they are recorded (the equivalent of writing’s substrate); the means used
for playback (a bit like writing’s script); and, if they record writing
or speech, language (just like writing). As the aforementioned examples indicate, audiovisual recordings are quite persistent. The recording
media aren’t necessarily very durable: vinyl, celluloid, magnetic tape,
plastics all decay, and in some cases quite rapidly. The type of celluloid on which early ﬁlms were recorded is both unstable and highly
ﬂammable. Needless to say, early ﬁlms were lost in great numbers.126
But audiovisual recordings can be easily transferred to more robust
media – for example, from analog ﬁlm to digital ﬁles – and thereby
preserved indeﬁnitely. Since the copies can be reproduced rapidly and
cheaply, audiovisual recordings are also protected by remarkable redundancy. With something on the order of 100 million copies of Michael
Jackson’s album Thriller ﬂoating around, it’s doubtful that it will ever
be lost.127 The techniques used to play Thriller back – analog recording
onto vinyl disks or magnetic tape – are, however, rapidly becoming
obsolete. If you can’t play an audiovisual recording, then you have
no audiovisual recording. But re-recording solves this problem as well.
You can just take the old, nearly obsolescent format and re-record it in
the new, very common one. Record companies, movie studios, and TV
networks have been updating formats for some time. The current wave
of updating – “digitization” – not only helps these companies preserve
their product, but also enables them to sell you the same product twice.
You bought Thriller from them on vinyl. Now you can buy it from them
again on CD. That’s quite a business plan. Or is it? Unfortunately for
audiovisual companies, new technology enables almost anyone to make
and distribute multiple copies of their products, so they may never have
the opportunity to sell you anything ever again. But we’re getting ahead
of ourselves. As for language obsolescence, it’s really not an issue as
of this moment. To be sure, there are recordings of extinct languages,
192

HOMO VIDENS

and there will surely be more if current trends continue.128 But the vast
majority of all audiovisual productions have been and are recorded in
major languages spoken by millions of people. None of these idioms is
at risk of dying or morphing into something unintelligible, at least for
the next several hundred years.
Audiovisual media, we can safely conclude, are quite persistent. Your
embarrassing collection of ’70s disco records will disappear, but – alas –
disco itself will never die. Persistent media give rise to additive networks,
that is, those in which data accumulate rapidly. If you take your unloved
disco albums to the thrift store, they will take their place in the bins
next to all the other unloved disco albums. In places where disco is still
the rage, even more disco albums are being produced, adding further to
the awful total. According to our theory, additive networks historicize
social practices evolved in and around them. In such networks, the
artifacts of the past build up in the present, making progressively more
of the past visible and manipulable. Time horizons recede; history is
written and rewritten.
There can be no doubt that audiovisual media historicized social
practices. Writing made the human past more visible than speaking.
Printing made it more visible than writing. But in neither case could one
really “see” or “hear” what had happened before. Audiovisual media
changed that. They transmitted the sights and sounds of the past to the
present so that the past could be “replayed” in a stream that anyone
could “get.” This ability – to travel, as it were, to the past and see it and
hear it as it was – proved extraordinarily attractive to the powerful, the
powerless, and everyone else interested in re-experiencing what had happened “before.” The result was the practice of audiovisual “documentation.” The idea of documentation – “the accumulation, classiﬁcation,
and dissemination of information”129 – was conceived in its modern
form by bibliographers in the early twentieth century.130 Its object was
paper, or rather the data on paper. But the term quickly migrated to nonﬁction ﬁlm. In a review of Robert Flaherty’s 1926 ﬁlm about Samoans,
Moana, the Scotsman John Grierson wrote that the ﬁlm had “documentary value.”131 The name “documentary” stuck. By 1932, the British
Commission on Education and Cultural Films could report “A deliberate documentary ﬁlm must be a transcript of real life, a bit of what
actually happened, under approximately unrehearsed conditions.”132
Around the same time, “documentation” migrated to folk music, just,
193

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

as it happens, as the American Works Progress Administration launched
a massive project to “document” – that is, record – American folk
songs.133 Audiovisual “documentation” began as an elite phenomenon,
the kind of thing ﬁlm-makers and government-funded musicologists
did. But as the price of cameras and recording devices declined following World War II, audiovisual “documentation” became a mass
phenomenon. By the late 1960s, almost anyone could make a “documentary” of their family (that is, a “home movie”) and any would-be
Woodie Guthrie could record his songs (that is, make a “basement
tape”). If you were born after, say, 1970, it is quite likely that you or
one of your kin have a relatively complete audiovisual record of your
life, or at least the major events of your life. With it, you can travel back
in time to hear and see yourself, or so it seems.
The most signiﬁcant historicizing impact of audiovisual documentation, however, was mass surveillance. Of course, suspicious people
have always been listening, watching, and recording (usually by writing) what they heard and saw. But until the advent of audiovisual
media, they had to do it in person or by proxy. That made surveillance
expensive – hiring people to inform on other people is not cheap – and
ambiguous – oral and written reports tend to be fuzzy. Affordable bugs
and video cameras made mass surveillance inexpensive and seemingly
unambiguous.134 It’s hardly surprising, then, that they proved quite useful to those with an interest in listening and watching. In the past several decades, surveillance devices have spread to a host of public spaces:
parks, shops, ofﬁces, roads, and just about any other place where anyone might do something wrong. They are found in many private spaces
as well, for example, in the homes of people who use “monitors” to
listen to and watch their children and those who take care of them.135
The ubiquity of audiovisual surveillance, in turn, has changed the way
we act. We all know that we can be “caught” by these machines, and
therefore we behave accordingly. You might be able to refute a written
account of you running a red light, but “pictures don’t lie.”
Interestingly, our faith in the probative value of the audiovisual
record spawned an interest in how that record might be manipulated
for one greater good or another. The Soviets took an early lead. Since
Lenin didn’t really like the way the Winter Palace was seized in 1917 –
a walk-over followed by a drunken riot – he had it restaged in 1920
and made a propaganda ﬁlm.136 As far as many Soviet citizens knew,
194

HOMO VIDENS

the ﬁlm was the storming of the Winter Palace as it actually happened.
But what to do about embarrassing historical photos, like the ones that
showed Lenin and Stalin working hand-in-glove with “Enemies of the
People” like Trotsky? Stalin knew.137 If Trotsky is in the photo, take
him out. No Trotsky, no problem. Richard Nixon’s aides did a similar sort of thing with the so-called Watergate Tapes, that is, tapes of
conversations between the president and his lieutenants recorded in the
Oval Ofﬁce.138 The tapes apparently had something quite damaging
on them, so Nixon had an 18.5-minute segment erased. No tape, no
problem. Over time, the art of doctoring audiovisual records became
much more sophisticated. Today that art is so advanced that recordings, photos, and ﬁlm no longer have the same “documentary” value
that they once had. You never know whether a recording has been
“remixed,” a photograph has been “Photoshopped,” or a ﬁlm has been
“green screened.”
That was the “is” of the situation: audiovisual media enable us to
capture and preserve more of the present than was ever possible with
speech, writing, or printing. The “ought” evolved to justify audiovisual archiving was a robust form of temporalism that we might call
“vigilism.” Recall that the central idea in any mode of temporalism is
that things change over time. Vigilism takes this idea and adds another:
that we should record things as they change so that we can compare
past and present. Sometimes vigilism is innocent, as when we compile
garage-band recordings, family photo albums, and home movies. Here,
vigilism tells us not to miss the “Kodak moment.” But, more often,
vigilism serves as a justiﬁcation for keeping other people in line. Here,
vigilism tells us that we must be watchful or we will suffer at the hands
of others, that we will need an incontrovertible, permanent record of
their misdeeds should they act badly, that this “proof” may be our only
defense against chaos. Of course we value our privacy, but vigilism tells
us that we must sacriﬁce a major part of it so that good order can be
preserved. And besides, “we” have nothing to worry about, because
“we” aren’t going to do anything wrong.
Searchability

Like unrecorded speech, broadcast audiovisual messages can’t be
searched at all because they vanish into the ether. Recorded audiovisual
195

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

messages can be searched, but it’s not easy. Many of us have probably
had the following frustrating experience. You want to show someone a
scene in a movie, for example when Bogart says “Play it again, Sam” in
Casablanca. You’ve got the videotape cued up. But where is the scene,
exactly? All you remember is that it’s in the ﬁrst half of the ﬁlm. There
is no scene index telling you when Sam plays “As Time Goes By,”
because videos don’t have such ﬁnding aids – almost no audiovisual
media do (though that’s changing). So you begin to hunt and peck. Fast
forward. Watch. No, not there. Back up. Watch. No not there. Start
again. Finally, you’ve found it. Only your recollection has deceived you.
Bogart doesn’t say “Play it again, Sam.” Instead, he says, “If she can
stand it, I can! Play it!”139 This is one of the most memorable – and
most misremembered – scenes in all of ﬁlm history. Finding it should
have been a snap. But it took some time, because you didn’t really know
where it was and there was nothing to tell you. Now imagine trying to
locate a random scene – say footage of a three-legged dog – in a vast
ﬁlm archive. How would you do it? Well, you need to gain access to
a vast ﬁlm archive. There aren’t many of these and they don’t let just
anyone in. But let’s say you ﬁnd an archive and they let you in. Now you
have to search through the ﬁlms. If there are no good ﬁnding aids (and
there usually aren’t), that means you are going to have to watch them
one after another until you come upon your hobbled dog, if it’s there at
all. That is going to take time, particularly if the archive is large. Before
you ﬁnd the crippled dog footage, if you ﬁnd it at all, you are probably
going to have to watch a lot of ﬁlms, meaning you are going to “ﬁnd” a
lot of “non–three-legged-dog” before you ﬁnd any “three-legged-dog.”
That’s not very efﬁcient. But then again, neither is the entire process.
It would probably be faster just to ﬁnd a three-legged dog and ﬁlm it
yourself.
Audiovisual materials, then, are not very searchable, or at least they
haven’t been until recently.140 In most cases, you simply have to go
through them in order to get what you want. That’s time-consuming and
yields a lot more noise than signal. Media that are not readily searchable generate unmapped networks, ones that do not have an accurate,
ﬁne-grained system of addresses. Because information on the network
as a whole cannot be easily found and recovered, it tends to clump
in particular nodes. Our theory predicts that unmapped media networks will professionalize social practices evolved in and around them.
196

HOMO VIDENS

Since information becomes concentrated in certain nodes, inequalities
of knowledge appear. Some know more than others, and those who
do often join forces to perfect, protect, and otherwise restrict access to
their special knowledge.
In the last chapter, we saw how the spread of print worked to both
weaken some professions (theology) and strengthen many new ones
(those taught in the university). Audiovisual media had a similar effect,
though all in all, much milder. Although the live entertainment industry
was hardly destroyed by the advent of records, movies, radio, and TV,
it was appreciably changed. The theater, music hall, vaudeville circuit,
burlesque show, and their live cousins came to occupy a small niche in
a huge, audiovisual-centered entertainment market. The special knowledge that was required to put on one of these shows was no longer in
high demand, and so these “professions” shrank and faded. More accurately, they were winnowed and concentrated in audiovisual production units run by record companies, movie studios, radio networks, and
television networks. In the beginning, the only acts these outﬁts could
broadcast were ones that had been developed in the old world of live
entertainment. Music hall singers, theater company actors, vaudevillians, and Borscht-Belt comics were all staples of the early audiovisual
broadcasts.141
But the studios soon began to develop their own talent. “Develop” is
exactly the right word, for it gets to the heart of the difference between
the old live theater world and the new broadcast world. In the theater world, performers toured widely and only occasionally had the
opportunity to appear before very large audiences or even the same
audience many times. The act was often more important than the performer, though there were exceptions (e.g., Sarah Bernhardt). In the
broadcast world, performers would be – or, rather, could be – seen
by millions many times. As audiences grew and faces were committed to memory, viewers began to do something somewhat unexpected:
they strongly identiﬁed with the performers. The star became just as
important, or more important, than the act. It didn’t take long for the
studios to realize that stars could be made if the right promotional
techniques were employed.142 They set about building the legal, technical, and artistic infrastructure of the modern star system. Raw talent
would be taken and re-fashioned into an image that tested well. Protostars were put under contract, that is, required to do what the studio
197

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

said. They were re-named (Rock Hudson né Roy Harold Scherer Jr.),
given new biographies, and told to embody certain personae.143 Special vehicles were written and produced to suit their characters, be they
tough, loving, sexy, sentimental or what have you. Promotional campaigns were carefully crafted, replete with leaks that weren’t leaks and
scandals that were made up. Thus, the “dream factory” was built. The
degree to which it operated in any given sphere of audiovisual media
varied. The movie studios were the most proﬁcient star-makers, with
the record companies, radio, and TV networks lagging but putting in
a good effort. The point to remember, though, is that only these nodes
in the network had the resources and know-how to make a star. They
made “show business” a modern business. And they were and are very
good at what they do, as they can make almost anyone – whether they
have “talent” or not – into a star, or at least a reasonably well-known
and therefore bankable celebrity. How else do you explain Pamela
Anderson?
That was the “is” of the situation: those who knew how to make stars
made them and those who didn’t listened to and watched them. The
“ought” deployed to justify this clumping of useful knowledge was a
form of collectivism that stressed the essential and highly valuable contribution that audiovisual “professionals” made to the commonweal.
They were allowed to use the public airwaves, were permitted to serve
as guardians of the pubic culture, were paid handsomely by the public
itself, and were, therefore, bound to act in the public interest. They
had, as the saying goes, a “civic duty.” Once more we see two variants
on this doctrine, both born in the Print Era. According to the weak
version, found in capitalist nations, the moguls and the stars they made
were simply encouraged to contribute to the betterment of the nation,
though they were under no strict obligation to do so. If they didn’t, of
course, they would likely suffer at the record store, box ofﬁce, or in the
ratings game. So when they were asked to pony up, pitch in, or come
around, they usually did.144 According to the strong version, found in
socialist countries, the moguls and stars had no choice in the matter:
they were the people.145

In Plato’s story, King Leontius could not help himself. Even though he
was a reasonable man, reason could not restrain his curious eyes. He
198

HOMO VIDENS

had to look at the corpses rotting under the gallows, and he felt ashamed
that he could not stop himself. In one sense, audiovisual media have
made Leontiuses of us all. We all have to look, even when we know in
our heart of hearts we shouldn’t. The reason is that there is something
deeply psychologically compelling about audiovisual media, something
more forceful than talking or reading. This fact is demonstrated every
day of our lives. We live in a world of relatively unconstrained media
choices. In our own free time, we can talk, read, listen, or watch as we
choose. And what do we choose? The answer is obvious: we listen and
watch more often, for longer, and more pleasurably than we talk and
read. Further proof of this native preference is the fact that the choice is
largely independent of content. When faced with reading a good book
or watching an awful TV show, most people will watch the awful TV
show. And here we come to the difference between Leontius and us. He
felt guilty about his compulsion to look at things not deserving of his
attention, things that might do him harm, things that teach nothing. We
don’t. We say everything is worthy of our attention – only snobs think
otherwise. We say nothing heard or said can do us harm – only prudes
think otherwise. And we say everything teaches something useful – only
the narrow-minded think otherwise.
We may or may not be right in holding these opinions. But as we’ve
tried to point out in this chapter, there is good reason to believe that
they are themselves a product of audiovisual media. The audiovisual
media – like all media – have physical attributes that engender particular
kinds of networks, networks that in turn produce certain kinds of social
practices and values. Table 5 summarizes this process with regard to
audiovisual media.
Naturally, audiovisual media do not necessarily generate these results
and, when they do, do not generate them to the same degree. The
impact of media can be blunted and, with great effort, even eliminated.
Try to picture a society in which everyone owned, say, a television
broadcaster-receiver. That would make TV very accessible on both
the send and receive sides. Let’s say, further, that these personal TV
broadcaster-receivers had some strange attributes. They can be simply
concealed, making TV private on both the send and receive sides. They
can transmit nothing but text, making them low ﬁdelity. They can
transmit only short messages irregularly, making TV low volume. They
broadcast only over a short radius, making TV short range. Everything

they transmit is recorded, making TV persistent. Finally, what they
transmit is well indexed, making TV highly searchable.
In theory, all this could be done. In practice, however, it hasn’t been
and probably can’t be. As was the case with print, many powerful organized interests – churches, states, parties, corporations – have sought
to control audiovisual media or alter their natural effects. And as with
print, they have done so in the name of ideas across the entire political spectrum. But they have all failed. Almost everywhere, audiovisual
media did what audiovisual media naturally do. Thus, modern societies, whether they be capitalist or communist, democratic or authoritarian, developed or primitive, seem awfully similar as regards the way
audiovisual media are deployed. Everywhere we ﬁnd audiovisual media
concentrated in the hands of a relative few. Those few, however, are
at least nominally dedicated to providing a public service. Everywhere
we ﬁnd people consume audiovisual media primarily in private according to their own tastes. The right to watch and listen to what you
will is enshrined in the laws and customs of almost every nation on
the planet, although of course it is often disregarded. Everywhere we
ﬁnd the audiovisual media dominated by entertainment, usually of the
low-brow variety. Content through the audiovisual channel is usually
meant to stimulate, not educate. Everywhere people consume audiovisual media, but they almost never produce it. No one really talks back
to their TV set, nor do they seem to want to. Almost everywhere we
ﬁnd incredible variety in the audiovisual media – it spans the globe and
brings the globe into your living room. The exception here, and it’s an
important one, are illiberal regimes that impose censorship on foreign
broadcasts. They, however, are dying. Everywhere we ﬁnd vast repositories of audiovisual materials, not only in the hands of consumers,
200

HOMO VIDENS

but also in libraries and archives. These cultural “treasures” are often
protected by the state in the interests of the public. And ﬁnally, everywhere we ﬁnd what amounts to a guild of audiovisual producers, a cast
of professionals who know how to “do” audiovisual magic. People do
not themselves know how to produce audiovisual items, and they do
not generally want to learn how.
This, then, is Audiovisual Culture, the product of the audiovisual
media and the organized interests that brought it into being. Judging its
success is made difﬁcult by the fact that it is not very old and really still
with us. It seems likely, however, that it will not be with us for long
(see the following chapter). So on that score – longevity – it is a failure
compared to Talking Culture, Manuscript Culture, and Print Culture.
Whether it is – or was – good for humanity is an open and much
debated question. No one seems to doubt the value of talking, writing,
or print for the human project. Many critics, however, wonder whether
the audiovisual media have contributed anything of lasting worth to
our collective endeavor. And it must be admitted that these critics have
a point, for the audiovisual media seem to naturally appeal to our desire
for diversion rather than our need for ediﬁcation. Audiovisual media
may, as one detractor says, cause us to “amuse ourselves to death.”146
But we will never ﬁnd out, for the Audiovisual Era is passing out of
existence even now. It is, as we will presently see, being pushed aside
by a medium whose message is even more mixed – the Internet.

Humanity in the Age of the Internet

– Next then, I said . . . Picture people as dwelling in a cavernous underground
chamber, with the entrance opening upward to the light, and a long passageway running down the whole length of the cave. They have been there since
childhood, legs and necks fettered so they cannot move: they see only what is
in front of them, unable to turn their heads because of the bonds.
– A strange image, he said, and strange prisoners.
– Like ourselves, I replied.1
– Plato, The Republic, 514A

In Plato’s cave, nobody sees what’s really happening. They think they
do, but they don’t. Plato says we are like the cave dwellers. We think
we see the Truth, but we don’t. The difference is that we can see the
Truth if we know how. Plato knew how and wanted to show us. But
Plato also knew that we – or at least most of us – are either incapable
of or uninterested in coming to grips with the Truth. Philosophers have
the way and the will, but the rest of humanity doesn’t. We are quite
happy living in our pleasant illusions, far removed from the Truth. This
is why we build the imaginary worlds – dramas – that Plato found so
disturbing. For what are storytelling, literature, and theater but attempts
to escape from reality into some fantasy? The storytellers, writers, and
thespians all say we can learn something about ourselves from their
productions. But what do we learn, really, if all that is depicted is
ﬁction? Fiction cannot be the Truth, for it is the opposite of the Truth.
And even those productions that claim to be something other than
ﬁction – histories and the like – aren’t they simply poor reﬂections of a
reality that is gone and cannot be revisited, and therefore really ﬁctions
themselves?
202

HOMO SOMNIANS

Perhaps they are, and perhaps they aren’t. In any case, Plato was on
ﬁrm ground in asserting that we naturally seek the comfort of illusions.
He would not, therefore, be at all surprised by what we have done with
the Internet. For there we have created a cave of absolutely immense
proportions. In it we see only the reﬂections of real people and things,
the shadows they leave for us to observe on the screens before us. Unlike
his prisoners, we are aware that they are there behind the electronic
wall. Yet we don’t know who or what they “really” are, and we don’t
much care. It’s usually better if we don’t know, for that makes the
illusion more powerful. All that is important to us is that they provide
gratiﬁcation, that they present a virtual reality that is satisfying to us.
Some part of it may not be agreeable, but the cave is so large and its
variety so great that we can be certain we will ﬁnd something diverting,
amusing, or even useful in it. Just what that something is will happily
remain our own business, because, although there are millions of us
in the cave, we are functionally alone. The prisoners in Plato’s cave
cannot see each other. Neither can we see each other on the Internet,
that is, if we don’t want to be seen. We are free, therefore, to look
where we will without regard for the judgments of others. An added
beneﬁt is that we, unlike Plato’s shackled captives, can cast our own
shadows. This is both enjoyable for us and pleasing to others. Whether
our projections are truthful, reasonable, or digniﬁed is largely beside
the point. For the point of our virtual world is to entertain and be
entertained, and that goal is sometimes best achieved by lies, foolishness,
and impropriety. Most important, we believe that none of it matters
precisely because we are in the cave and not in real life. We reject
absolutely one of Plato’s central premises, namely, that playing at acting
badly and watching other people play at acting badly will somehow
harm us.
Perhaps we are right, and perhaps we are not. Time will tell. It
is certain, however, that we are currently in the middle of a signiﬁcant
change in the way we communicate with one another, a change brought
by the Internet. As we will presently see, the change was sudden and
is having a signiﬁcant – though all in all, predictable – impact on the
way we organize ourselves and think about what is right and what is
wrong. Plato believed we should seek the Truth. The Internet suggests
other ends.

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

why we surf
In order to show that the “pull” theory of media evolution explains the
rise of the Internet, we need to demonstrate two theses. First, we must
show that the technology behind the Internet was available some time
before the Internet itself. If it were, then it makes sense to conclude that
people could have developed the Internet but didn’t because demand
was insufﬁcient. Second, we need to show that some new moment
in world history made existing media – talking, manuscript-writing,
printing, and audiovisual media – insufﬁcient for the purposes of some
organized group or groups, and that this or these groups elaborated
a preexisting technical capacity – in this case, the ability to network
computers – into a new medium.
What evidence, primary and secondary, can be brought to bear on
these two propositions? On the one hand, we have all the data we need
at our ﬁngertips because the Internet and the social practices and values
we claim it engenders are all around us. Any careful observer of the
Web and modern life should be able to judge whether and to what
extent the theory we have presented is valid. On the other hand, our
task is made difﬁcult by the very fact that we are immersed in a new and
evolving phenomenon. No one offered a compelling explanation of the
impact of talking, manuscript-writing, print, or audiovisual media in the
early days of those modes of communication. Although the literature
pertaining to the effects of the Internet is already large and growing
quickly, what’s on offer – much of which is somewhat hyperbolic2 – is
disappointingly vague.3 It may just be too early in the game to gain the
perspective needed to offer an accurate assessment of what the Internet
is doing and will do. Maybe, but probably not. As we’ll presently see,
in the instance of the Internet, the past is a remarkably good guide to
the future.
The Internet before the Internet

The story of the Web properly begins in sixteenth-century Europe during the Scientiﬁc Revolution, for it was then and there that the project
that would end in the Internet was conceived in its modern form. That
project was the systematic collection, classiﬁcation, and dissemination
of knowledge for the purpose of scientiﬁc progress.4 The initial spurs
204

HOMO SOMNIANS

that urged European thinkers to pay close attention to data gathering, classiﬁcation, and dissemination were two. The ﬁrst spur was the
revival of ancient Greek scientiﬁc interests and practices. Aristotle and
his peers stimulated Europeans to think anew about the world of the
senses, the more so now that their many works were widely available
thanks to print. No better example of the new attention to data collection, classiﬁcation, and dissemination can be given than that of Tycho
Brahe, whose exact observations of celestial bodies helped his assistant,
Johannes Kepler, formulate his eponymous laws of planetary motion
and revolutionize our understanding of cosmology.5 The second spur
was imperialism. The people of the Renaissance had the good fortune
of “discovering” (to put it very mildly) new worlds, and when they did,
they imported new things from them by the ton. These novelties were
often categorized and displayed in early museums of natural history –
cabinets of curiosities (Kunstkammern or Wunderkammern). Scientiﬁcally minded elites created the ﬁrst such institutions in the mid-sixteenth
century.6 By all reports they were big hits. The impulse to collect and
catalogue was a characteristic of the age, as we can see in the pathbreaking methodological writings of Francis Bacon, proto-information
scientist par excellence. Bacon is most famous for the saying “knowledge is power.”7 He seems to have believed it. In a number of still-read
books, Bacon outlined a program to banish ignorance and superstition
by collecting, measuring, analyzing, and comparing everything. Like so
many ambitious programs, it proved largely unworkable.
Happily, some of Bacon’s fellows and followers were rather more
practical than he. The founders of the early scientiﬁc societies not only
theorized about collecting and exchanging data, they created organizations to do it. The result of their handiwork can be seen in the
Italian Accademia dei Lincei (founded 1603), the English Royal Society (founded 1660), the French Académie des sciences (founded 1666),
the Prussian Akademie der Wissenschaften (founded 1724), and the
Russian Akademiia nauk (founded 1724).8 Before these societies, natural philosophers had only very limited means to discuss their work
with like-minded colleagues. The early scientiﬁc societies and statesponsored institutions – especially research universities – improved this
situation dramatically. Together they created the basic structure for
handling scholarly information that persisted until the birth of the Internet. This system comprised three institutions. The ﬁrst was the library,
205

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

which allowed scientiﬁc information to accumulate in one place for
easy access. The second was the index, which permitted information in
the library to be retrieved. And the third was the article (in a book or
journal), which allowed scientists to share information at a distance.
The entire system worked in a loop: scientists produced journals that
fed the libraries that were indexed by bibliographers who then supplied
them to scientists who produced more journals, and so on.
The new system of scholarly communications constituted a real step
forward, but it was by no means perfect. Far from it. Libraries concentrated information, which was good. But they also isolated it, which was
bad. You had to go to the library, it could not come to you. So if you
weren’t near the library you needed or if you were near and couldn’t get
in, you were out of luck. Indexes helped you ﬁnd information, which
was good. But they also hid it from you, which was bad. Alphabetical
or subject indexes generally do not penetrate – or do not penetrate very
far – the items they index. In an ordinary card catalogue, you get the
author, title, a few subject headings, and the book’s location in the
stacks. Almost everything between the covers is obscured. This is to say
that you really had to know exactly what you were looking for before
you started to look, and this is inconvenient if you don’t know quite
what you want. Articles provided a convenient means to share scientiﬁc
information on a speciﬁc topic, which was good. But they shared the
deﬁciencies of the library and the index, which was bad. That is, if you
didn’t have access to the article for whatever reason – a subscription
cost too much, the library lost it, your dog ate it – it might as well not
exist. And even if you did have access to it, there was no really efﬁcient
method to ﬁnd out exactly what was in it other than to read it carefully – not a very efﬁcient way to track down speciﬁc facts. In short, the
entire thing didn’t work well for people who: (a) didn’t have access to
a big library; (b) didn’t know exactly what they were looking for; and
(c) didn’t have the time or patience to read everything that might have
what they wanted. That pretty much describes everyone who wasn’t a
student or professor at a university.
The problem was recognized. As early as the eighteenth century,
enlightened souls were trying to ﬁgure out ways to improve scholarly
communications and bring trustworthy knowledge to the people who
needed it. The French encyclopedistes felt that the existing mechanism
of separating truth from superstition, disseminating the former and
206

HOMO SOMNIANS

discarding the latter, was wanting. To rectify this sorry situation, Denis
Diderot, Jean le Rond d’Alembert, and their philosophe allies revived an
old (Greek, as it happens) idea – the encyclopedia.9 They set themselves
the task of compiling all that was true and useful in one place for all
time. The result was the epoch-making thirty-ﬁve-volume Encyclopédie,
ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers (1751–).
Yet the Encyclopédie and its imitators (especially the Encyclopedia
Britannica [1768–] and the Brockhaus Enzyklopädie [1796–]) were
limited by the medium in which they were produced, namely print.
Books are ﬁne for many purposes, but if your object is to provide a
universal store of knowledge in which anything can be found instantly
and anything can be amended as needed, they are not ideal. Anyone
who has every used a print encyclopedia knows that they are big but
not complete; well-indexed, though not well enough; and often updated,
though never really current.
Print not only limited the degree to which scholarly communications could be perfected, it also limited the imaginations of the men
and women who were trying to perfect it. Diderot, d’Alembert, and
the Enlightenment gang just couldn’t conceive of a way to store, ﬁnd,
and transmit information outside the ink-and-paper paradigm. A bit
latter, however, some began to see past the printed book. One such
visionary was the French bibliographer and information scientist Paul
Otlet.10 Otlet didn’t much like books. He felt – correctly – that they
concealed as much as they revealed. They were full of data that was
basically hidden from researchers and, more importantly to the progressive, Internationalist Otlet, hidden from humankind in general. To
Otlet, the existing means of storing, categorizing, and conveying information hindered human progress. But Otlet had a solution – the humble
3 × 5 index card. Otlet and his colleagues wanted to use the index card
to crack the book, that is, to extract from the standard scientiﬁc print
medium every bit of discrete information it held. According to Otlet’s
plan, these unique bits would be recorded on 3 × 5 cards and classiﬁed
according to an exhaustive universal index so that information could be
found and easily retrieved. He called his index the “Universal Decimal
Classiﬁcation.” It was a kind of Dewey Decimal System on steroids.
Otlet even dreamed of creating a Rube Goldberg-esque workstation
in which scholars would use levers to ﬁnd and extract cards from his
massive universal card catalogue. It was all quite mad. The engineering
207

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

problems presented by print made Otlet’s vision utterly impractical. For
all that he was ahead of his time, Otlet was still thinking in terms of
print.
New technologies such as microﬁlm inspired his followers to think
past print, sort of. One of the most obvious problems with print as
a mode of communications is its bulk and weight. A piece of paper
is small, but thousands of pieces of paper are big. A piece of paper
is light, but thousands of pieces of paper are heavy. Big, heavy things
are expensive to transport. This makes them unattractive as media (cf.
stone tablets). One way to surmount this problem, however, is to shrink
the big heavy thing into a small light thing. Publishers have known
this trick for centuries, and they have endeavored to test the limits of
human vision by publishing ever smaller books with ever smaller type.
Interestingly, if you are really devoted (not to say crazy), you can pack
a lot of text into a very small place by hand. According to legend,
followers of Mao inscribed the entire contents of his Little Red Book
on a six-sided die. Such feats are impressive, but not very practical.
The real breakthrough in tiny text came with the invention of practical
photography by Louis Daguerre in 1839.11 It took less than a year for
one of Daguerre’s admirers, the lens grinder John Benjamin Dancer
of Manchester, to begin miniaturizing photographs for viewing under
microscopes. In its early days, microphotography was nothing but a
novelty. Rene Dagron of Paris was given the ﬁrst microphotography
patent in 1859. His chief product was a tiny image embedded in a tiny
viewer embedded in a tiny trinket. Yet a few forward-thinking people
at the time recognized that microphotography might be made to serve
more practical purposes. In 1859, the same year Dagron patented his
bauble, the Photographic News wrote that microphotography might
allow “the whole archives of a nation [to be] packed away in a small
snuff box.”12 Given the state of miniaturization at the time, it would
have had to have been a very big snuff box. But no one needed to build
such a box, because no one was really thinking of putting government
archives on tiny bits of photographic paper – governments had more
important things to think about.
Businesses didn’t. In the early twentieth century, banks – theretofore
used largely by rich folks and merchants – became truly retail businesses.
Everyone began to use them, and thus they found themselves having to
track millions of transactions, not only deposits and withdrawals (done
208

HOMO SOMNIANS

at the bank, so easily recorded), but also checking activity (done off site
with third parties, so more difﬁcult to record). In the mid-1920s, New
York banker George McCarthy saw in microphotography a potential
solution to the bank’s paperwork problem.13 With this in mind, the
plucky money man invented the “Checkograph,” a device that produced microﬁlm copies of checks ﬂowing through ﬁnancial institutions.
For obvious reasons, Eastman Kodak loved the Checkograph, bought it
from McCarthy in 1928, and began to sell microﬁlming services under
its Recordak brand. By the 1940s, governments, university libraries, and
corporations began to microﬁlm their holdings. They did so with some
urgency. Even as Recordak ﬁlmed, entire cities were being wiped off
the map in World War II, taking entire government archives, academic
libraries, and corporate vaults with them. The ordinarily upbeat President Franklin Roosevelt stressed that the United States needed to microﬁlm everything “so that if any part of the country’s original archives
are destroyed a record of them will exist in some other place.”14 He
uttered these words a bit over a month after the Pearl Harbor attack in
which, as a matter of fact, “original archives” had been destroyed by
Japanese bombers. It seems he expected more of this to come. If he did,
he was right.
The notion that microﬁlm might be used to preserve and disseminate
some knowledge – banking records, government archives, and such –
rather naturally led the futurist H. G. Wells to the idea that it might
be used to preserve and disseminate all knowledge. Wells proposed the
creation of a “Permanent World Encyclopedia” that would capture and
convey all of the world’s wisdom by means of very tiny text.15 “At the
core of such an institution,” he writes, “would be a world synthesis
of bibliography and documentation with the indexed archives of the
world. A great number of workers would be engaged perpetually in
perfecting this index of human knowledge and keeping it up to date.
Concurrently, the resources of micro-photography, as yet only in their
infancy, will be creating a concentrated visual record.” Such a record
is, he says, already being created by “American microﬁlm experts” who
are making “facsimiles of the rarest books, manuscripts, pictures and
specimens, which can then be made easily accessible upon the library
screen.” By means of this remarkable technology, he gushes, “there is
no practical obstacle whatever now to the creation of an efﬁcient index
to all human knowledge, ideas and achievements, to the creation, that
209

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

is, of a complete planetary memory for all mankind.” One suspects
that Wells did not have much hands-on experience of the “practical
obstacles” presented by microﬁlm. Indeed, as anyone who has ever
used it can attest, such enthusiasm for microﬁlm can only have been
born of never having used it. Wells, it seems, never touched the stuff.
The next wave of information scientists had probably used microﬁlm, so they knew to look elsewhere for inspiration. The elsewhere in
question was in the rapidly developing ﬁeld of information-handling
machines. The notion that one could use mechanical means – wedges,
gears, levers, etc. – to store information and even solve mathematical
problems was hardly new. The people who built Stonehenge over 4,000
years ago knew it; the Greeks who built devices to predict the position
of celestial bodies in the second century BC knew it; the inventors of
the slide rule in the seventeenth century knew it. So did one Vannevar
Bush, engineer, science tsar, and technological visionary.16 In the ﬁrst
of these capacities, Bush built the “Differential Analyzer” in 1927, a
device that could solve complicated differential equations very quickly
and accurately. In the second capacity, Bush ran the Ofﬁce for Scientiﬁc
Research and Development, the bureau that oversaw the Manhattan
Project and all military research in the United States during World War
II. In the ﬁnal capacity, Bush wrote “As We May Think,” an essay
published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1945.17
Today Bush is remembered primarily for “As We May Think.” It’s
little wonder, for it is a remarkably prescient essay. In it, he plainly says
that gummed-up scientiﬁc communications are a huge problem. “Professionally,” he writes, “our methods of transmitting and reviewing the
results of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate
for their purpose.” Researchers produce more useful information than
ever, but more than ever is simply lost due to an antiquated system of
storage, search, and retrieval. “The summation of human experience,”
Bush complains, “is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means
we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily
important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged
ships.” In a word, the print paradigm – libraries, indexes, and articles –
just wasn’t doing the job anymore, if it ever did.
Bush proposed that the basic problem was the linear way that information was stored, indexed, and retrieved in print. Finding a “record”
in a library catalogue was like walking a narrow, conﬁned path: you
210

HOMO SOMNIANS

could go forward or backward, but you couldn’t leave the trail. “The
human mind,” Bush pointed out, “does not work that way. It operates
by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next
that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with
some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.” Bush
dreamed of a workstation that could store and retrieve huge volumes of
information, but which mimicked the way the brain related bits of data
by subtle “associations.” In the former aspect, Bush’s “Memex” looks a
lot like Otlet’s data contraption, replete with levers, gears, buttons, and
plenty of microﬁlm. It is the latter aspect – sorting by fuzzy, expandable,
and user-directed association – that makes Bush’s Memex noteworthy.
Like Otlet, Bush dreamed of cracking the book, that is, ﬁnding a way to
extract and isolate every bit of useful information in it. But his “associations” went beyond Otlet, for they allowed researchers to freely create
new sources that could then be cracked by other researchers. “It is
exactly,” Bush wrote, “as though the physical items had been gathered
together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a
new book.”
Bush was ahead of his time, not only in terms of his ideas but also in
terms of the technology available to realize them. Yet help was on the
way. It came from the U.S. Defense Department.18 After World War II –
which, as you will recall, had gone pretty badly for all sides involved,
though worse for some than others – the American military became
concerned about preventing “another Pearl Harbor.” The U.S. generals
had good reason to be worried, as the potential consequences of a sneak
attack had grown much more terrible in the terrible nuclear age. So,
they wisely set up a system of radar installations designed to detect airborne incursions from sea to shining sea. The radar bases worked ﬁne,
as radar itself had been thoroughly battle-tested during the aforementioned world war. In fact, the bases worked a little too well, that is, they
provided too much information too fast for even the smartest generals
to handle in a reasonable amount of time. And said generals did not,
in fact, have a reasonable amount of time to sort through the reams
of data and decide what to do, for the attacking planes – ﬂying very
fast – would arrive at their targets only minutes after the radars detected
their presence. Something needed to be done to improve what the military calls “command and control” or, they said, we’d all be blown to
hell. So the defense establishment decided to build a computer-aided
211

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

information network, the world’s ﬁrst. Made operational in 1959,
SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) brought everything the
decision makers needed to know – including radar images, an innovation – to central locations so the deciding could be done. SAGE also
assisted the decision makers – via automation, another innovation – in
scrambling ﬁghters and guiding them to their airborne targets.19 Once
again, science and technology had made America safe.
But then another problem arose, a hypothetical one posed by one
of the many professionally paranoid people governments employ to
dream up nightmarish hypothetical scenarios. What would happen, this
thinker of the unthinkable asked, if one of the enemy’s bombers got
through the radar-based, electronically linked, computer-assisted earlywarning system and managed to drop a bomb on the system itself?20
The answer was plain: the system would crash and take America’s
ability to make good decisions about what to do next with it. This
just wouldn’t do. So, in the early 1960s, the government decided to
invest some effort in creating a more robust network, one that wouldn’t
collapse like a house of cards if one of its cards were pulled away (or
blown to bits, as the case may be). Happily, there were some very
smart young scientists working on just this problem at various wellthought-of universities around the globe. They proposed an ingenious
solution: break the system’s messages up into chunks, send the chunks
through multiple paths in the network, and reassemble them at the end.
That way, if any path were destroyed, the several parts of the message
would still get through by traveling along other paths and could be
reassembled as if nothing had happened. Humpty Dumpty could be put
back together again. This disassembly-reassembly system was called
“packet switching” over a “distributed network.”21 It seemed to be a
good solution to the problem of network fragility, and the American
government was pleased to fund and implement it.
But scientists working on the new communications system pointed
out yet another problem, as scientists will. It’s ﬁne to switch packets
and distribute networks, but the computers doing the switching and
distributing have to be able to talk to one another. Computers, you may
recall, were sort of new at the time, and a lot of people were building
them. Computer companies generally built computers that could talk
to the ones they built, but not to the ones that other people built. So
there were a lot of computers that couldn’t talk to one another, many
212

HOMO SOMNIANS

of them in the American defense establishment itself, as it was the
primary market for expensive computers. This was bad. But it wasn’t
the only difﬁculty, the scientists warned. Rather more selﬁshly, they
noted that not only were mute computers bad for the nation’s defense,
they were also bad for science itself. You see, mathematicians, engineers,
and physicists – all the folks who are so vital to America’s security –
love to talk to one another. They must do so, and often, in order to
accomplish their work efﬁciently and effectively. If their computers
couldn’t talk to one another, neither could they, and science would
suffer. So the scientists proposed a solution that would solve both the
generals’ problem and theirs: a set of computers and computer protocols
(a sort of lingua franca for machines) that would link not only the
defense establishment’s computers in a distributed network, but theirs
(or rather, those owned by their research institutes and universities) as
well. The American government, being wealthy, worried, and respectful
of scientists, decided to fund and implement this program too. So was
the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) born in
1969.22
Alas, neat though it was, ARPANET wasn’t very useful if you weren’t
a general or a computer scientist. This was true for a variety of reasons,
but the chief one was that you couldn’t get to ARPANET from your
network, wherever your network was. And there were several good
ones in different places around the country and world. Just as a lot
of computer companies were producing computers that couldn’t talk
to one another, there were serious establishments (especially scientiﬁc
institutes and universities) creating networks that couldn’t talk to one
another. The military didn’t care much, because it had its own network
and, prizing secrecy as military folk will, didn’t really want anyone
else on it. But communications-hungry scientists did care, because they
wanted to trade information in the service of scientiﬁc progress. What
was needed, they said, was a network of networks, a massive grid
that would enable every scientist to talk to every other scientist no
matter what network he or she was on. As many parties and interests
were involved, it took well over a decade, a lot of negotiation, and
a boatload of money to create this “inter-network.” But by the mid1980s, the network of networks – the “Internet” – was alive and well,
linking most big institutes and universities in the nation, and some
overseas.23
213

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

Although the Internet was much bigger and more accessible than
ARPANET, it was still pretty hard to use. You could exchange messages, ﬁles, and even run some programs remotely, but beyond that
you couldn’t really do much unless you were an expert. This bothered
an English fellow named Tim Berners Lee. He worked at a big Swiss
physics laboratory, and it was his job to make it simple for scientists
to collaborate. Since it plainly wasn’t simple, he set about designing
a way to make the Internet useful as a collaborative tool. He ﬁgured
that what people really wanted out of a network was access to things
on computers, not computers themselves. After all, when you use the
phone, you want to talk to someone, not simply connect to another
phone. It’s the same with the Internet. You want to use it to get information in documents, not to connect to computers. So in the early
1990s, he and a French colleague designed a system that used the Internet to store, receive, and send documents, and he called his invention
the “World Wide Web.”24 On the World Wide Web, you seem to move
from document to document, reading what you want and moving on.
The computers are just where they should be, in the background. Technical people almost immediately recognized that the Web was extremely
useful, and they made it a kind of a standard.
At this point, the Internet and the Web that ran on top of it were
still obscure. People in the computer industry knew about it, because
they make their living building gadgetry. Scientists knew about it,
because they enjoy collaborating with colleagues in distant places. And,
ﬁnally, geeks – especially young geeks – knew about it, because young
geeky people make it their business to know about the latest technical
advances. While the computer-builders were busy building networked
computers for the collaborating scientists, a team of young geeks in Illinois had a monumental insight.25 First, they noted that a lot of people
were buying desktop PCs running the Windows or Macintosh operating systems, not UNIX, which was standard in “serious” computing.
Second, they noted that these PCs could be hooked up to the Internet
by phone lines. Third, they noted that our frustrated English fellow
in Switzerland had already created a kind of software that made it
easy to send, receive, and store multimedia documents on the Internet,
although his program was kind of clunky and not very pretty. So these
college students put one, two, and three together and set about creating
a really intuitive, clean, multimedia “Web browser” for users of PCs.
214

The browser was something like a combination of a glossy magazine –
full of pictures and text – and a TV beamed right into your home. It
made the Internet easy to understand. In 1993, these college students
cum entrepreneurs began to give their graphical Web browser away
under the name “Mosaic.” Suddenly it was not only easy to get on the
Internet, but once you were there, it was easy to get around. By the
mid-1990s, “surﬁng the net” was an activity like reading the newspaper, listening to radio, or watching TV, although there wasn’t much in
the way of newspapers, radio, or TV on it.
“Pulling” the Internet into Existence

And so the Internet was born. Its deepest roots, as we’ve pointed out,
were scientiﬁc. In this sense, the Internet is the fulﬁllment of the 400year-old dream that information might be collected, stored, and sifted
easily, efﬁciently, and endlessly. Yet science itself did not “pull” the
Internet into existence in the last quarter of the twentieth century. No,
there were larger systemic forces at work, all of which are hinted at in
the story we have just told. Generalizing, they were three: information
capitalism, the surveillance state, and cultural privatism.
First, there was information capitalism.26 Industrial capitalism, a
product of the eighteenth century and one of the motive forces behind
the spread of audiovisual media, is about producing goods. It still exists,
as we still need things produced industrially, for there is no more efﬁcient way to make them. But, beginning in the twentieth century, industrial capitalists noted two things. First, they saw that the data-handling
requirements of modern business were becoming a drag on productivity
and, more important, on proﬁtability. Second, they understood that the
return on investment in research and development could be signiﬁcant,
particularly in a legal framework that protected intellectual property
and an economic framework – the public company – that allowed
rapid ﬁnancing and development. These two insights put a new and
higher premium on information production, manipulation, and storage.
Knowledge might be power, but information was money. Companies
became interested in what were aptly called “business machines.” Calculating engines had been around since the seventeenth century. Both
Pascal and Leibniz built them.27 By the 1880s, they were being produced commercially, and by the 1890s, they were becoming common
215

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

in ofﬁces throughout the developed world. The companies that made
calculators and other early data-processing machines (punchers, tabulators, sorters) are still with us today: IBM, NCR, Burroughs (now
Unisys).28 They invested resources in researching and developing new
products and supplied a steady stream of them to businesses seeking to
make their operations more efﬁcient. Somewhat surprisingly, computers were a relatively late addition to the game. First built in the 1940s,
they – “mainframes” – long remained much too expensive for most
businesses. With the advent of time-sharing by dial-up connection in
the 1960s, more businesses began to use computers in their operations.
But it was really only after the introduction of the PC in the late 1970s
that computers become a staple of ofﬁce work.
It was the spread of the PC that was to be businesses’ primary contribution to the rise of the Internet, for, by giving computer manufacturers an incentive to produce low-cost, portable, easy-to-use machines,
they put computers within reach of large numbers of consumers. This
provided a kind of mass “base” for the rapid take-off of the Web
in the 1990s. Some thought was given to how networked computers
might aid collaborative work, in business and out. Examples include
Ted Nelson’s “Project Xanadu” (1960s), Murray Turoff’s “Electronic
Information Exchange System” (1976), Irene Greif and Paul Cashman’s
“Computer Supported Cooperative Work” (1984), and Charles Findley’s “Collaborative Networked Learning” (1986).29 But, by and large,
businesses were caught off guard by the rapid expansion of the Internet.
However, once they saw it for what it was – both a new place and a new
way to conduct business – they very quickly exploited the opportunity
it provided, thereby hastening its expansion.
The “pull” of information capitalism, however, paled before that of
the surveillance state.30 The welfare state was all about providing goods
and services at a minimum level to its citizenry. In order to fulﬁll this
mission, however, it needed to collect and crunch a huge amount of data.
If you are going to send pension payments to everyone over 65 years
of age, you need to know (a) where the money is going to come from;
(b) who is going to process it and how; and (c) where the money is
going to go. That might not seem like a lot of information until you
consider that it requires you to know a host of other things: who works
where, what they do, how much they earn, where they live, what they
own, what they owe, what sorts of families they live in, to whom they
216

HOMO SOMNIANS

are related, how old they are, and sundry other difﬁcult-to-anticipate
items. Then multiply the task by many tens of millions. As the scope of
the “safety net” expanded to include educational entitlements, health
insurance, unemployment insurance, survivor’s beneﬁts, and all the
other “rights” afforded to citizens, so too did the information-handling
requirements of the state grow. It’s not surprising that the enterprise
that became IBM got its start building machines to tabulate the results
of the U.S. censuses of 1890 and 1900.31 Neither should it be unexpected that government bureaucracies remained the best customers of
the makers of business machines throughout the twentieth century.
The pursuit of national welfare, however, was not the only reason modern states needed to ramp up their information-collecting and
data-handling capacities. There were less savory grounds as well. One
we have already touched on was the need to ﬁnd more efﬁcient ways
to kill people and prevent them from being killed. The U.S. Defense
Department funded virtually all of the research that led to the production of the ﬁrst American computers, the ﬁrst American computer
networks, and the immediate forerunner of the Internet, ARPANET.32
This investment was by far the most powerful factor “pulling” the Web
into being in the second half of the twentieth century. Another factor was “state security,” or rather insecurity. Governments have been
spying on their subjects for eons, but the scope and intensity of clandestine state surveillance expanded radically during the twentieth century.
This was especially true in the socialist world, where enemies were suspected under every rock, and party dictatorship ensured that every rock
would be picked up without objection from the public. But it was also
the case in democracies and semi-democracies, particularly during the
periodic “Red Scares” that marked the century. Time and again, free
governments set civil liberties aside in order to surreptitiously surveil
the free citizens in whose interest they supposedly governed. Sometimes
they had reason. Sometimes they didn’t. But in either case the task of
surveillance put an additional load on the state’s information-handling
capacity, and thereby helped “pull” the Internet into existence.
Finally, there was cultural hedonism.33 In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, cultural liberalism helped bring the modern audiovisual
media into being by putting a ﬁg leaf on impropriety. You could show
most anything in public, so long as bodies remained clothed, speech
clean, and messages “wholesome.” The Hay’s Code and its fellows
217

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

made most everyone a hypocrite, which was ﬁne with most everyone.
Appearances had to be maintained. Until the 1950s. For reasons that
go far beyond the scope of this book, polite hypocrisy began to fall out
of favor in that decade in much of the Western world. Like Holden
Caulﬁeld, a lot of people suddenly found themselves surrounded by
“phonies.”34 Some of these people are cultural icons today: Hugh
Heffner, who founded Playboy in 1953; Aldous Huxley, who issued
The Doors of Perception in 1954; Jack Kerouac, who published On
the Road in 1957.35 In a sense, all three of these men were hinting
at the same thing: appearances don’t need to be maintained because
they aren’t being maintained as it is. We should, therefore, do away
with appearances and openly embrace what is “real.” And that, for the
proto-pornographer, the advocate of drug use, and the poet of loafing about, was raw experience. The rising generation, it turned out,
was very receptive to this notion.36 It became central to the shift in
mores that took place during the 1960s, the wake of which we still
live in today. Heffner’s, Huxley’s, and Kerouac’s philosophy (if it can
be called such) rested on a utilitarian logic that was as compelling as
it was simple: all you know and are is what you feel, and therefore
the “good life” should be spent in the pursuit of feelings, especially the
good ones. Combined with a convenient cynicism toward “the man” –
that is, the real world – this doctrine exploded into full-blown hedonism
under the thin guise of “mental expansion,” “consciousness-raising,”
and “getting back to nature.” Whether any minds were expanded, consciousnesses raised, or natures gotten back to in the 1960s and 1970s
is not at all clear. It is certain, though, that a lot of sex was had, drugs
were taken, and loaﬁng about done. Not surprisingly, the people who,
moving far past anything Heffner, Huxley, and Kerouac ever imagined,
trumpeted the virtues of radical hedonism became heroes to the merrymakers and were made celebrities by the press. The names of Timothy
Leary, Ken Kesey, and Hunter Thompson still ring today.37 They were,
after a fashion, serious people, or at least famous people, which increasingly amounted to the same thing. The intellectuals of hedonism added
a veneer of high-mindedness to the pursuit of raw experience.
The problem, however, was that once right-thinking people had
agreed to condone high-minded hedonism, they were defenseless against
the low-minded variety. Any such differentiation would make them hypocrites, and recall that it was the ﬁght against hypocrisy that started the
218

HOMO SOMNIANS

slide into hedonism in the ﬁrst place. If you approved of Hugh Heffner,
Aldous Huxley, and Jack Kerouac, it was hard to consistently disapprove of Larry Flint, Snoop Dogg, and Charles Bukowski. These “free
spirits” were all just “doing their own thing,” which is what everyone
was supposed to do. The courts more or less agreed. By the mid-1970s,
only two classes of expressions could be constitutionally censored in the
United States: (1) those that were likely to promote “imminent lawless
action” (Brandenburg v. Ohio, 1969); and (2) those that a community
deems obscene and a reasonable observer would ﬁnd lacking in any
serious “literary, artistic, political or scientiﬁc value” (the Miller Test,
1973).38 In practice, this meant that nothing beyond credible death
threats and kiddy porn was banned. The FCC could censor more, but
really only on the public airwaves. The 1960s and the birth of cultural
hedonism set the stage for the Internet. By the moment of its birth,
people were ready for a channel in which they could hear, see, and
say anything. Print and audiovisual media could not supply this. The
Internet could and did.
Human Nature and the Internet

We saw earlier that whereas writing and printing spread slowly, audiovisual media took off in a few decades. The reason, we said, was in
part because we have a natural disinclination to read and write and
an inborn inclination to watch and listen. Interestingly, the Internet
took off even more quickly than the audiovisual media. In the span
of a few years, it covered the globe and penetrated every nation on
earth. The preexistence of an audiovisual infrastructure explains much
of this rapid spread and remarkable reach: the Internet “piggybacked”
on other networks, and so did not have to wait for new networks to be
built, as was the case with audiovisual media. But that doesn’t explain
the entire phenomenon. It seems sensible to say that there is something
about the Internet that appeals to our natures, a drive that makes us
want it. Is there?
The answer would seem to be “yes.” While it would not be fair to say
that the Internet pushes all our evolutionary buttons, it certainly pushes
more of them than any other single device in history. As we’ve said,
humans were designed to look for anomalies and solve puzzles. The
Internet is full of anomalies and puzzles. The world is a very big place
219

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

and people are doing all kinds of things. You don’t know about most
of them. But now they are putting them on the Internet for you to ﬁnd.
Just about any search you perform, no matter how speciﬁc, is likely to
return results that surprise you and present you with things to ﬁgure out.
It’s all there: the odd, the weird, the strange, the peculiar, the curious,
the bizarre, the uncanny, the mysterious – everything. What is more,
because you are on the Internet, you can quickly and easily do some
research to clear things up. That’s the idea, at least. So you surf from link
to link to link, uncovering more and more and more information. Yet,
as you do, you uncover new anomalies and puzzles that lead you in new
directions. A book is a machine for focusing attention; the Internet is a
machine for diffusing it. A book takes you on a trip from here to there;
the Internet takes you on a trip from here to God-knows-where. Getting
lost is half the fun of it. Most of us have had the experience of casually
going to look something up on Wikipedia and ending up, an hour or
more later, in a place we never imagined, learning about something we
never knew existed. In truth, you don’t so much look things up on the
Internet as just look at things. This is something we clearly like to do,
an end in itself. So compelling is our desire for anomalies and puzzles
that some of the most popular sites on the Web are devoted to their
collection. Some of them are low-brow, like Fark.com, and some are
high-brow, like Metaﬁlter.com, but they all exist precisely because we
naturally ﬁnd the unusual, curious, and just plain weird entertaining.
These link-presentation sites exist for another reason, also evolutionary in origin. Not only do we need to ﬁnd what we called “relevance,”
but we are driven beyond reason to share what we ﬁnd with others.
We usually do this by talking, but the Internet has provided us with
a much larger forum in which to present our trophies. Some commentators make the mistake of calling what happens on the Internet
“exchange” and wax lyrical about how the Internet has unleashed a
long-repressed human desire to “collaborate.”39 But the truth is that
both exchange and collaboration on the Internet are results of the native
drive to present relevance to others, not the cause. Ultimately speaking,
we do not talk because we want to trade information or work together;
rather, we talk because we naturally enjoy it, and we naturally enjoy it
because talking – the presentation of relevance – increased our ﬁtness
eons ago. Similarly, we do not put things on the Internet because we
desire to swap information or cooperate with each other; rather, we
220

HOMO SOMNIANS

do it because we naturally enjoy putting things on the Internet, and we
naturally enjoy it because this sort of behavior – the presentation of
relevance – increased our ﬁtness eons ago. Posting is the continuation
of talking by other means.
This is easy to demonstrate. People often wonder why anyone contributes to Wikipedia. Indeed, it’s something of a puzzle if you look
at it in terms of cost-beneﬁt analysis, as least as cost and beneﬁt are
usually understood. What are the costs? Well, there is the time and
effort you spend editing. But you spend a lot of time on the Internet anyway, so that’s a minor expense. More signiﬁcantly, there is the
very real possibility that your edits will be erased and, to add insult
to injury, that you will be abused by angry strangers whose hardheadedness is matched only by their ignorance. Wikipedia can be a rough
place. What are the beneﬁts? Well, you certainly don’t get paid, which
is the way most people who work expect to be rewarded. Neither do
you attain glory, for most contributors edit Wikipedia anonymously or
at least pseudonymously. Contributing just doesn’t add up. Yet thousands of people do it. There are probably many reasons – the desire to
participate in something “bigger than yourself,” the fellowship of the
“collaborative community,” or the simple alleviation of boredom. But
the basic reason people contribute is that they ﬁnd it enjoyable, and
they ﬁnd it enjoyable for easy-to-understand evolutionary reasons. The
Internet is like a great game of show-and-tell, and we like show-and-tell
a lot.
Another button that the Internet pushes is our desire to experience
what we called “intrusive stimuli.” These, it will be recalled, are a class
of sounds and sights that we are preprogrammed to pay close attention
to, whether we like it or not. They include depictions of sex, food, drink,
power, wealth, conﬂict, and violence. From an evolutionary point of
view, these stimuli are always relevant and therefore instinctively draw
our ears and eyes. It goes without saying that the Internet is brimming
over with material of this sort. Obviously, there is more pornography in
more ﬂavors than one can easily comprehend. But not only that. Even
“mainstream” sites often have a quasi-pornographic visual style. They
show you things that you want to see but don’t have the opportunity or
stomach to see in “real life.” In the former category – opportunity – one
would put all the commodity porn that populates so many commercial
sites: gadgets, cars, houses, clothes, and “bling” of every kind. In the
221

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

latter category – stomach – one would put the frequently disturbing
pictures and videos of misfortune that litter the Web: pratfalls, car
accidents, airplane crashes, and even people being beheaded. Looking
at the one and the other you often get a kind of rush. The feeling
may be superﬁcially pleasurable or unpleasurable. But in either case
it is a feeling, a kind of stimulation, that you desire on some very
deep psychological level. If you didn’t, you wouldn’t look. And you
always do.
Information capitalism, the surveillance state, and cultural hedonism
“pulled” the modern Internet into existence. They succeeded in doing
so rapidly and thoroughly in large measure because we are inclined by
nature to like – even to the point of personal harm – what the Internet
allows us to do. Once the door to the audiovisual media was opened,
we ran through it. Once the door to the Internet was opened, we ran
through it and, sometimes, stumbled.

what the internet did (and is doing)
Not even two decades ago, then, the world of the “Old Media” –
talking, manuscript-writing, printing, broadcasting – became the world
of the “New Media” – those carried by the Internet. In truth, that’s a
bit of an exaggeration in two senses. First, despite what you might have
heard, the “Old Media” have not and probably will not disappear, ever.
All the historical evidence suggests that major media are remarkably
persistent: new media don’t displace the old, they join them. Second,
and again despite what you may have heard, the Internet is not the
dominant mode of human communications today. Far from it. About 80
percent of Americans currently use the Internet regularly. On average,
they spend 17 hours a week online.40 Almost all Americans chat, read,
and watch TV. Every week they spend on average 13 hours chatting,
2.5 hours reading “for pleasure,” and 23 hours playing couch potato.41
Assuming they aren’t doing these things simultaneously, Americans live
in the world of the “Old Media” a lot more than they live in the world
of the “New Media” (21.5 hours a week more, to be exact).
According to our “push” theory of media effects, the addition of
the Internet to the mix should have altered social practices and values
in Audiovisual Cultures; it should have produced a distinct Internet
Culture in the distinct – and ongoing – Internet Era (1990 to the present).
222

HOMO SOMNIANS

As we saw earlier, our experience itself gives us abundant evidence to
test this thesis, and our experience over the past quarter century is
exactly what we will use to prove it.
Accessibility

There was a time, now dimly remembered, when computers were very
expensive and Internet access was rare. The IBM PC, released in 1981,
cost around $2,000;42 the original Apple Macintosh, released in 1984,
ran $2,500.43 Neither had modems. These cost around $225 in 1980.44
The Internet was in its infancy and there were no Internet service
providers (ISPs), but you could access bulletin board systems (BBSs)
for a few dollars a month. Today, you can buy any number of new,
fully functional PCs – computer, screen, keyboard, mouse, modem –
for less than $400.45 The philanthropic organization “One Laptop per
Child” is building a machine that will cost around $200.46 If you don’t
mind used computers, you can get one for the price of shipment. Internet access will cost you about $10 a month at home, but you won’t have
any trouble ﬁnding someplace where it’s free if you live in the developed
world. Every school, public library, café, and many cities offer gratis
wired or wireless access. And of course you get it at work for nothing,
if you don’t count the working part.
There was also a time, perhaps not so dimly remembered, in which
learning to use a PC and navigate the Internet was hard. Many of
us remember the wonders of conﬁg.sys, autoexec.bat, and the “blue
screen of death.” More of us, alas, know what TCP/IP and DHCP stand
for. In the main, however, the tendency has been for both “usability”
and “connectivity” to increase – that is, become easier – over time.
Many computers are now truly “plug and play,” though occasionally
they have to be re-plugged and re-played. The era in which the tech
guy was a god-king is not gone entirely, but it’s fading fast. Proof
that PCs and Internet access have become less costly in ﬁnancial and
training terms is borne out by the number of people who use them. It’s
estimated that there are more than one billion PCs in use worldwide
today, and that number will double by 2015.47 Something on the order
of 1.4 billion people have Internet access.48 Both numbers are rising.
There are 6.7 billion people on the planet.49 The digital divide, it would
seem, is closing rapidly.50 We should add that would-be monopolists
223

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

will have a hard time making Internet access any more expensive than it
naturally is, for the Internet’s logistical chain has no readily exploitable
bottleneck. Computers are made in too many places for production
to be controlled. They are small enough that they can be transported
relatively easily and secretly. Once in operation, they can be hidden.
Some Internet trafﬁc moves over telephone and cable lines, which can
be cut, but only at the loss of other important services. Internet signals
that are transmitted over satellites and picked up wirelessly are difﬁcult
to interrupt. Some tyrannical states have attempted to limit Internet
access.51 Not surprisingly, only North Korea has been really successful,
largely because it has no telecommunication infrastructure to speak
of.52 The country code for North Korea is +850, but don’t try to call
because almost no one has a phone.53 Satellite dishes and even cell
phones are periodically banned. The frightened leaders of China, Iran,
Cuba, and other shackled countries censor the Internet, but their ability
to do so in the long haul as satellite-delivered service expands seems
doubtful.
The Internet is a marvel of accessibility. If you want to get on it
and use it, you probably can. If you can’t now, you’ll be able to soon.
Accessible media foster diffused networks, that is, ones in which the
ability to send and receive messages is shared by a large proportion of
the population. In the developed world – Canada, the United States,
Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia – 40 to 80 percent
of the population have Internet access.54 In the less developed though
developing world – Mexico, South America, the Middle East, Russia,
China – 20 to 40 percent of the population have it. In the undeveloped
world – Africa, Central Asia, Southern Asia, Southeast Asia – between
0 percent and 20 percent do. Overall, about 20 percent of the earth’s
population can get on the Internet. According to our theory, diffused
networks equalize social practices and values evolved in and around
them. Diffused networks give everyone roughly equal power to send
and receive messages. Thus, it is difﬁcult for any particular sender or
receiver to monopolize communications and use unequal control to
create unequal power.
There are ways in which the Internet is not democratic at all. Governments regulate it, telecom companies own it, search engines dominate
it, and big corporations manipulate it. But having said all that, it’s probably the most democratic “place” in the world, at least in the sense of
224

HOMO SOMNIANS

having equalized social practices. In the real world, you are a person
with lots of traits – gender, race, class, and all of their subspecies –
that differentiate you from others; on the Web, however, you are most
often just a “user” like any other. Ofﬂine, Bill Gates is very rich and
you aren’t. But online, Bill Gates is a “user” and so are you. Citizenship
is to ofﬂine democracy as “user-hood” is to online democracy. Since
both you and Bill are “users,” everything you do together online – play
games, talk software, write encyclopedia articles – is going to be on a
“peer-to-peer” basis. Actually, all virtual social practices are equalized
in the sense of “more equal than in the real world.” They are not, however, equal for at least two reasons. First, the real world bleeds into the
online world. So Bill’s ofﬂine cred – if the “user” is really ofﬂine Bill
Gates – is going to win him points in the software discussion site that
you can’t score. Second, reputation matters in the online world. Bill
might really know what he’s talking about and develop a good reputation, while you might be a “troll” and develop a bad one. Bill’s online
“peers” are going to listen to him and they aren’t going to listen to you
(in fact, they may ask the “mods” – moderators – to ban you). If you
behave, however, you and everyone else will get a voice, just like your
“peer,” Bill Gates.
That is the “is” of the situation: everyone is on the Internet (or soon
will be) and everyone is more or less equal on the Internet. The “ought”
that followed was a peculiarly radical form of egalitarianism that took
the Print Era notion of the “marketplace of ideas” to an extreme. In
Print Cultures, everyone theoretically had a voice. But in practice, only
those who were willing and able to bear the cost of print expression
actually “spoke.” It was generally agreed that this restriction of voices
was a good thing: the “marketplace of ideas” would work only if those
trading ideas had some investment in them and knowledge of them.
In Internet Culture, everyone – or nearly everyone – actually has a
voice. The costs of expression are so low that anyone can “speak,” and
everyone does. The “marketplace of ideas” can work only with difﬁculty
in this cacophonous environment, so some additional justiﬁcation for
everyone “talking” at once had to be found. It was in the form of the
“wisdom of crowds,” according to which large, uncoordinated groups
of independent people “know” things that even experts don’t.55 An
important conclusion follows: if more people always know more, then
there can be no reason to restrict anyone from weighing in. By this
225

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

logic, more is better even when it’s not. Not surprisingly, some people
just don’t buy it, at least as it applies to the Internet.56
Privacy

It’s the most famous cartoon ever produced about the Internet. It’s been
reprinted thousands of times. Everyone has seen it. “On the Internet,
no one knows you’re a dog.”57 In the real world, everyone knows
who you are. Here’s why. First, you don’t get to decide who you are.
Others do that for you. You can’t elect to be blue if you’re born green.
You can try to pass as someone you aren’t, and some have. But the
difﬁculty and psychological toll are great. Witness Michael Jackson.
Second, you only get one identity at a time. You can try to lead a
double (or triple, or quadruple) life. This feat, however, is notoriously
difﬁcult to pull off, and usually ends in divorce, incarceration, or an
extended stay in a mental hospital. Third, you don’t get to change
identities. You can attempt to remake yourself. But if you really want
a new identity, you have to enter the FBI’s witness protection program.
That, alas, involves saying bad things about some very mean people, a
risky endeavor in itself. Finally, you often have to present your identity
to others in person. You can avoid the tête-à-tête with intermediaries,
letters, and the telephone. But when the deal is ﬁnally done, you are
often going to have to look the other fellow in the eye.
None of these rules applies on the Internet. You get to decide who
you are. Just pick a user name, “Bob,” and make up a false proﬁle. You
get to have multiple identities simultaneously. Just make up another
user name, “Betty,” and another false proﬁle. You can switch from one
identity to another easily. Toggle back and forth: Bob-Betty-Bob-Betty.
You never have to meet anyone face to face, for everything you want to
do can be done at a distance. Even having sex (of an electronic sort). This
doesn’t mean that you can’t be tracked down. Unless you’re an expert,
you can be found. But it’s going to take a lot of effort to get from Bob
and Betty to you if you are at all careful. As for your correspondence, it’s
relatively easy to conceal. Imagine some unauthorized someone wanted
to see a ﬁle you’ve placed on the Internet. They would have to know
where the ﬁle is. Happily, there is software available that will make a
ﬁle functionally invisible. If they knew where the ﬁle was, they would
need to get to it. Firewalls can stop them. If they manage to get to it,
226

HOMO SOMNIANS

they would have to be able to open it. Passwords can prevent them from
doing that. If they managed to open it, they’d have to be able to read it.
Encryption will prevent that. Someone really dedicated and smart will
probably be able to hack the ﬁle, but, again, they are going to have to
go to a lot of trouble.
The Internet, then, is very private indeed. With just a little effort, you
can hide who you are and what you’ve communicated behind multiple
layers of deception and security. People do it routinely. Private media
engender segmented networks, that is, ones in which information can
ﬂow in conﬁned, restricted spaces but not between them. According to
our theory, segmented networks will close social practices evolved in
and around them. For a whole variety of reasons – some noble and
some base – people like to hide what they do, and the Internet enables
them to do this like no medium before it.
The Internet has allowed people to accomplish something unprecedented: the creation of private though public social space. This may
seem like a contradiction in terms, but that’s only because most of
us have never had the experience of being unidentiﬁable in public. If
you’ve been to a masked ball, then you’ve come close. But even there,
you can probably be identiﬁed because masks don’t mask very well.
On the Internet, however, you can achieve true anonymity: your ofﬂine
self will remain private, while your online self – your “avatar” as it is
sometimes called – remains open for all to see. When you are anonymous, all of the social practices in which you engage are closed in the
sense that they cannot be identiﬁed with your ofﬂine self. If you want
a partial “second life,” all you need do is pick a pseudonym. If you
want a complete “second life,” you can ﬁnd it in any number of online
virtual worlds.58 In either case, you needn’t worry at all about what
others think of you, because “you” are separated from your actions.
You – that is, the real you – are not accountable.59 It’s well understood
that when people are not accountable, they do things they ordinarily
wouldn’t and probably shouldn’t. “When the cat’s away, the mice will
play,” as the proverb has it. It’s no surprise, then, that the Internet is
full of such bad behavior, or at least behavior that is deemed bad by
ofﬂine standards.60 Yet, even if you decide to enter the online world
using your true ofﬂine identity, you can still easily create a closed space
and a closed social practice within it. You simply build what is commonly referred to as a “walled garden,” that is, a network that cannot
227

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

be penetrated from the “outside.” Within the garden, you and the other
“users” will be able to do as they please without regard for “public”
censure. Clearly, the possibilities for such closed “collaboration” are
endless and somewhat disturbing.
That is the “is” of the situation: people are going to do all manner
of things – good and bad, wholesome and sick – with the cover provided by the Internet. The “ought” evolved to justify this wide range
of hidden behaviors was an old mode of privatism expanded to encompass new “digital” forms of expression. Offensive speech, pictures of
naked ladies, and really tasteless art were all enjoyed by people of the
Print and Audiovisual Eras. So too are they enjoyed by people in the
Internet Era, though in vastly greater quantities and varieties. No new
legitimating doctrine, therefore, was needed, for the “right to privacy,”
the “harm principle,” “obligatory tolerance,” and “aesthetic populism”
were already on hand, gifts of Print and Audiovisual Culture. The Internet did, however, give rise to new forms of extreme “private” expression that didn’t seem to have any direct equivalent in those earlier ages
and therefore might not be covered by the inherited doctrines. Virtual
child pornography is the clearest and most disquieting example. In a
2002 decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled that it, too, was
protected by the First Amendment.61
Fidelity

Many people speak of the Internet as if it were a radically new mode
of communication. In some ways it is, as we’ve seen and as we will
see later on. But in other ways, it’s not new at all. Take the kinds
of data it delivers. There’s speech: you can talk to people over the
Web using Skype. There’s writing: you can correspond with them using
email. There’s print: you can read all manner of printed material on
the Web. And there are audiovisual media: you can listen to music,
look at pictures, and watch videos on the Web. The Internet, then, is a
telephone, a post ofﬁce, a library, a radio, a photo album, and a TV all
rolled into one. Which of these is new? None of them. “New” would
be a medium that carries tastes, smells, and feeling. Sense-o-Rama may
be coming, but the Internet isn’t it. Despite what the boosters say, what
we have in the case of the Internet is old wine in new bottles, at least
in terms of data-type. On the Internet, speech, writing, and print are
228

HOMO SOMNIANS

still ﬁve-to-one codes: they reduce every kind of experience to linguistic
symbols born by sound (speech) or vision (writing and print). Internet
“word pictures” still aren’t pictures. On the Internet, audiovisual media
are still one-to-one codes. Internet sounds are sounds; Internet pictures
are pictures. Enthusiasts will object that the Web enables people to do all
kinds of artsy new things with these media, things that were impossible
in the old world. At best, that’s an exaggeration. At worst, it’s just
untrue. Decades before the Internet, artists were mixing, mashing, and
otherwise manipulating speech, writing, print, and audiovisual media
for fun and proﬁt. Go to MOMA or any collection of modern art
and see. What is deﬁnitely true is that computers – not the Internet –
have made messing about with the traditional media a lot easier than it
was when Andy Warhol made art out of soup labels. If Andy had had
Illustrator and Photoshop, he could have saved himself a lot trouble.
But the Internet wouldn’t have made much difference.
In terms of the kinds of information it delivers, the Internet is nothing
but the sum of its parts. These are two: a low-ﬁdelity channel carrying
speech, writing, and print, and a high-ﬁdelity channel carrying audiovisual messages. Hence, we have a dual network. When used to send
and receive messages through the low-ﬁdelity channel, the Internet will
generate symbolic networks. Users on these networks have to “know
the code” – that is, how to read – in order to use them effectively.
Some of them will, some of them won’t, and some of them will fall in
between. When used to send and receive messages through the highﬁdelity channel, the Internet will generate iconic networks. Users on
these networks have to know a code, but it is so natural – listening
and watching things “as they are” – that no conscious decoding will be
required. They will just “get it,” and they will all do so to roughly the
same degree. According to our theory, symbolic networks conceptualize
social practices developed in and around them, while iconic networks
sensualize them. The Internet is a dual network, so it should do both.
It does, but even this is not entirely new. The Internet is not the ﬁrst
medium to deliver two channels, one low- and the other high-ﬁdelity. In
principle, writing can deliver two: a writer, for example, can draft text
and draw pictures in a sketchbook. In principle, audiovisual media can
deliver two: a TV producer can create a broadcast with both text and
images, for example, a ﬁlm with subtitles. These, however, are really
marginal cases, for in the instance of writing, words dominate, while
229

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

in the instance of TV, pictures do. We read writing and watch TV; we
almost never watch writing and read TV. The ﬁrst medium to approach
a balance between the two channels was print, especially in recent
times. The modern glossy magazine – Time, Sports Illustrated, Playboy – deﬁnitely has two channels. You get words and you get pictures.
You never get one without the other, even in really wordy magazines
like The Atlantic Monthly, The New Yorker, or The Economist. These
considerations suggest a surprising conclusion: the Internet looks a lot
like a “slick,” as they say in the magazine trade. It’s pretty hard to
ﬁnd web pages that are only words or only sounds and images. You
almost always get both. Yet there is a difference between the way channels are employed in print and on the Internet. It’s one of weighting.
By and large, in print the low-ﬁdelity channel (text) dominates, thus
print networks are primarily symbolic, and therefore the most pronounced effect is the conceptualization of social practices and values.
In contrast, on the Internet the high-ﬁdelity channel (sounds and images)
dominates, thus Internet networks are primarily iconic, and therefore
the most pronounced effect is the sensualization of social practices and
values.
And sensualization is just what we ﬁnd. Earlier we saw that audiovisual media engendered social practices centered on the consumption
of “cheap thrills,” that is, stimulating, low-cost entertainments. The
Web continues and ampliﬁes this trend by further reducing the costs
of the production and consumption of “cheap thrills.” Some of these
are genuinely new – the multiplayer online games, for example – but
most are traditional, which is to say they are images, music, or video.
On the production side, the Internet (and attendant computer technologies) enables almost anyone to create or at least copy a picture, a
song, or a movie. These items, in turn, can be distributed to millions
upon millions of “users” via “ﬁle-sharing” sites. Thus, we ﬁnd millions of amateur “cheap thrills” on the Internet, as well as many that
would seem to be made by professionals and nominally protected by
the laws of copyright. On the consumption side, everything on offer,
whether copyrighted or not, is free because all the “users” were doing
was sharing. Add the fact that all of these free “cheap thrills” could be
consumed in private, outside the censorious gaze of the public, and you
have the recipe for an explosion of entertainment unprecedented in the
history of the media. If you ﬁnd it stimulating, you can ﬁnd it on the
230

HOMO SOMNIANS

Internet – all the time, for free, and probably in quantities and varieties
you never imagined.
That is the “is” of the situation: people are going to use the Internet
to stimulate themselves in every imaginable way. The “ought” developed to excuse self-stimulation was a form of realism that we might
call “virtual Romanticism.” Here again we see very little that is new:
the Audiovisual Era’s soft-core and hard-core Romanticism, premised
on the notion that any sound or image that makes you feel good is
“enriching,” was simply transferred to the online world. The principal
difference between the old Romanticism and the new virtual version has
to do with acquisition of “cheap thrills.” In the Print and Audiovisual
Eras, there was no way to get “cheap thrills” except by paying for them,
and so it was generally agreed that people should pay for them so that
the people who created them would create more of them. That was the
basic reason for copyright – to stimulate the production of entertainment. As we’ve seen, though, the Internet made it possible to get “cheap
thrills” for nothing by simply copying and distributing them, which is
exactly what millions of “users” began to do. This “is” caused many
right-thinking people to wonder whether stealing might not be stealing,
at least in this case.62 They muster a number of arguments to support
this odd view. They claim copyright is unnecessary: the “creative class”
will create even without it. They claim copyright is broken: the Internet
has made the protection of intellectual property practically impossible.
They claim that copyright itself is stealing: you can’t really own ideas,
as they belong to everyone. And they claim that the victims of copyright infringement will become its ultimate beneﬁciaries: the emerging
“economy of attention” will make it so. Reasoning in this way, they
conclude that the mass infringement of copyright is not stealing. How
could it be stealing if it’s good for us and good for the copyright holder?
Of course, not everyone is convinced.63
Volume

In the previous chapters, we measured the capacity of media to carry
information in terms of chunks and ﬂows. Speech, writing, and print
messages come in chunks, discrete packets of a typical size. The larger
they are and the more of them that can be delivered, the higher the
volume. Audiovisual messages generally (though not always) come in
231

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

ﬂows, continuous streams of data all of the same size from the consumer’s perspective. The more of them there are, the higher the volume.
What’s curious about the Internet is that it turns chunks into ﬂows. Not
all chunks: Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) “calls,” for example,
still come in discrete bursts of a certain size and duration. They start,
things are said, and then they stop. But the Internet deﬁnitely moves
writing and print toward the ﬂow end of the spectrum. Take writing.
Although email messages are discrete, email itself is always “on.” The
line is always open. Your inbox is ﬁlling up. You can always check it
and, if need be, respond. Thus, the conversation – as opposed to a particular conversation – never ends. It simply ﬂows on and on. Take print.
Although web pages are also discrete entities, that’s not really the way
you experience them. You “surf” through them one after another in a
continuous stream. You stop when one grabs your attention, read a bit,
then move on. But there is always one there in your browser, awaiting
your attention, approval, or disapproval. It’s true that writing and print
don’t ﬂow on the Internet in the same way as sound and sight. In the
former case, you have to make the media ﬂow by clicking, while in the
latter case, they ﬂow past you automatically. Nonetheless, the effect
of both is nearly identical: a continuous stream of texts, sounds, and
sights. In this sense, surﬁng the Internet is like watching captioned TV,
with one crucial difference: there are millions of channels on the Web.
Just how many millions, no one knows. More than 100 million registered domain names are currently active.64 According to one recent
estimate, there are in excess of 170 million websites (although only
about 700,000 are active).65 Since any of these sites can have many
pages, and many do, the number of total web pages runs well into the
billions. One rough estimate is that there are over 27 billion pages on the
indexed Web.66 And that’s only the part of the Web search engines can
see. The “Deep Web,” that part which has been hidden (see “Privacy”),
is probably much larger.67
The Internet, then, has extraordinarily high volume. It currently has
too many channels to comprehend, and more are being added at a
fantastic rate. This is hardly surprising. Anyone with a wired computer, a little know-how, and something to say can add their own drop
to this electronic ocean. Since just about everybody has all three, the
electronic ocean is expanding rapidly. High-volume media engender
unconstrained networks, that is, ones that have plenty of spare capacity
232

HOMO SOMNIANS

above and beyond what is deemed necessary for essential communications. According to our theory, unconstrained networks will hedonize
social practices and values developed in and around them. The reason
is this: people are pleasure-seeking. Thus, if a medium has extra bandwidth, people will use it for the purposes of pleasure. The Internet has
ample spare capacity and has, as a result, hedonized social practices
and values.
In the last chapter, we saw that the excess capacity of audiovisual
media allowed people to create the social practice of “leisure,” that
is, a time for relaxation and, more than likely, the consumption of
audiovisual stuff. The Internet has even more excess capacity, so we
shouldn’t be surprised to learn that it engendered even more “leisure.”
It did this in two ways: by changing the way entertainment is made and
changing the way it’s delivered.
First, consider entertainment production. In the Talking, Manuscript,
and Print Eras, we generally made our own fun and little of it involved
the media. In the Audiovisual Era, we paid people to make our fun
for us and it was the media. In terms of entertainment, the Internet
Era is like the one and the other: we make our own fun, but we use
the media – or rather the Web – to do it. This isn’t to say we don’t
hire people to entertain us on the Web. We certainly do. All the traditional entertainment companies – publishers, record companies, ﬁlm
studios, radio stations, TV channels – make their products available on
the Web, usually for a fee. The difference is that they do not dominate
the Internet in the way they ruled print and audiovisual media. The reason is simple: bandwidth. Print and audiovisual media don’t have much
of it, comparatively speaking, so only big companies can afford it. The
Internet has an inﬁnite amount of it, so anyone can get into the entertainment game. You’ve written the great American novel but can’t get
a contract? Post it online. You’ve penned the greatest song since “Puff
the Magic Dragon” but can’t ﬁnd a distributor? Post it online. Your
one-minute remake of Star Wars isn’t getting any attention from the
studios? Post it online. We tell our children to think they are geniusesin-the-making, teach them to emulate geniuses-in-fact, and then tell
them to sit down and shut up. It’s hardly a surprise that there have
long been millions of frustrated Hemingways, Dylans, and Scorseses
out there who just needed a break. Now the Internet has given it to
them and to all of us.
233

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

Second, there’s delivery. In the Audiovisual Era, entertainment was
what we might call “then-and-there.” I Love Lucy was on at 6:00 PM
on Mondays in your “TV room.” You had to be “then-and-there” to
enjoy it. This being so, audiovisual companies made sure that their best
programming was broadcast when and where people had free time at
home. Thus TV, for example, colonized evenings, that is, “primetime.”
On the Internet, however, entertainment is “always-and-everywhere.”
You don’t have to enjoy it at a particular time and place; you can enjoy
it any time and any place, or some approximation thereof. You, not
some programmer at a big media company, decide when and where to
look, listen, or watch. The liberation of entertainment from time and
space, however, had a peculiar effect: it allowed “leisure” to colonize
all the times that were not otherwise occupied by work and traditional
media. These periods tended to be short: a few minutes waiting for the
doctor, riding the bus, or between tasks at the ofﬁce. But “short” is just
what the Internet offers. Articles, picture essays, songs, games, videos –
they can all be enjoyed in a few minutes. The result is that the Internet
has increased the total time people spend at “leisure.” Since a lot of this
increased “down-time” is spent at work, employers and economists are
worried about the cost of “workplace Internet leisure browsing,” or
“cyberslacking,” as it’s sometimes called.68
That is the “is” of the situation: people are going to use the inﬁnity of
Internet bandwidth to produce and consume entertainment like never
before. The “ought” developed to justify this behavior was a form of
hedonism composed of two parts, one old and the other new. The
old part was the Audiovisual Era’s notion that modern life was so
stressful that you needed to relax in order to remain healthy. Surﬁng
the Internet is an aspect of necessary “self-care.” The proof of this
doctrine was born out by some suspiciously comforting studies that
demonstrated that surﬁng the Internet at work increased productivity.69
The new part revolved around the idea of “self-expression.” Of course,
the notion that self-expression is essential to self-development is not
new: the Romantics loved it.70 The Internet didn’t so much alter the
self-expression-is-self-discovery line as democratize it. It’s one thing
to tell children, as Maria Montessori did, that self-expression would
unlock their protean selves when, as adults, they wouldn’t do a whole
lot of self-expression, at least in public.71 It’s another to tell children
the same thing when they can, as both children and adults, simply go
234

HOMO SOMNIANS

online to express themselves to millions. Yet that is precisely what we
tell our children and precisely what they are doing. They are making
their own entertainment and at the same time becoming better people,
or so we say. Not everyone is impressed with the result.72
Velocity

Email and chat have always been fast. It doesn’t take long to compose messages and, once sent, they arrive almost instantly if everything
is running according to spec. Thus, you can easily “talk” to someone over them. Web pages are a different story, or at least were. For
most of the 1990s, making and editing web pages was a slow process
because every alteration had to be hand-coded, that is, you had to write
the HTML. If you didn’t know HTML, and most people didn’t, then
updates were especially slow. “Slow” here means hours, which may be
fast to you and me, but is an eternity in Internet time. In any case, hours
between updates meant that you couldn’t really have a conversation on
or between web pages. Rather, you could have a series of monologues,
and that really isn’t very satisfying. So, in the late 1990s, some impatient
programmers with a lot to say invented tools that allowed them to edit
web pages quickly and easily.73 Thus was the Blog born, and with it
the ﬂood of read/write web pages that are now ubiquitous on the Web.
You’ve probably heard the term “Web 2.0.”74 You may not have heard
the phrase “read/write Web.” They mean the same thing – it’s just that
the former is an opaque buzzword promoted to sell electronic soap,
while the latter is a pretty good description of what many people do on
the Web today, and have since the early 2000s. You read something on
a web page and then you write something about what you read on the
same web page. Then other people read what you just wrote and they
write back. The back-and-forth can happen instantly, just like talking
to someone; or it can be drawn out, like an email exchange. But in either
case it is what it is: a conversation. These days you are not limited to
reading web pages and writing to them. You can listen, look, or watch,
and then respond in kind. So a more accurate description of the Web
today would be the read-listen-look-watch/write-record-photographvideo Web. One doubts that clumsy tag will catch on, but the point is
the same: the Internet allows you to create and transmit messages in
several formats very quickly, and thereby facilitates discussion.
235

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

The Internet, then, is a high-velocity medium: you can compose and
send messages very quickly, and others can respond to them. This you
cannot really do with writing, print, and audiovisual media. Highvelocity media generate dialogic networks, ones in which messages
can be quickly and easily exchanged between nodes. The “turn-around
time” on such networks is short, or at least can be short. You compose
a message and send it. It arrives quickly and is understood. And the
recipient composes and sends a response. Thus, messages ﬂow back
and forth over the network rapidly and easily. According to our theory,
dialogic networks democratize social practices developed in and around
them. By “democratize” we mean to encourage deliberative and consensual decision making. People like to talk, and they like to be heard.
Dialogic networks give them the opportunity to do both at a low cost.
The Internet is a huge dialogic network made up of millions of
smaller dialogic networks – an Inter-network, a network of networks.
Wikipedia, for example, is one of them. Most people would say
Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia. It sure looks like one. It’s comprised of short descriptive entries, just like an encyclopedia. They are
written in a “stick-to-the-facts” style, just like an encyclopedia. They
cover a remarkably broad range of topics, just like an encyclopedia.
Wikipedia, however, clearly isn’t an encyclopedia in the traditional
sense, and some critics say it’s not an encyclopedia at all. The reason
most commonly cited for Wikipedia’s “un-encyclopedia-ness” is that it
is written by amateurs rather than experts. But that can’t really be right,
for in point of fact many amateurs contribute to Britannica and many
experts to Wikipedia, though the proportion of each is surely different
in the one case and the other. The real difference between traditional
encyclopedias and Wikipedia is the medium in which they are realized
and the way in which those media shape their form.
As we’ve said, writing and print are inherently monologic because
they do not permit the rapid production and exchange of messages. The
traditional encyclopedia is a perfect example. An artifact like Britannica
takes many years to organize, write, edit, typeset, print, and distribute.
And once it’s done, it’s done: the articles themselves cannot be edited. It
is true that the production of the next edition will involve an exchange of
information. The new authors will enter into a “conversation” of sorts
with the old authors – and the “literature” in general – as they go about
updating entries. But is a “conversation” that takes place over decades
236

HOMO SOMNIANS

or even centuries really worthy of the name? No matter what we call it,
one thing is clear: the lag between “call” and “response” – a function of
the logistical characteristics of the medium – seems unnaturally long. In
contrast, the Internet as it exists today is inherently dialogic in that it not
only permits rapid exchange of information but encourages it. Imagine
you’ve been asked to write a Britannica entry. It might take you a short
time – you just slap something together. Or it might take you a long
time – you write a carefully crafted, informed article. When you’re done,
as we said, you are done. Now imagine you want to write a Wikipedia
entry. The goal is the same, and it’s your choice how you want to
pursue it. You can settle for “good enough” or strive for excellence.
The difference is that when you’re done, you aren’t done. In fact, you –
or rather the article you’ve started – is never done. Ever. This is because
anyone can edit “your” article at any time or leave comments about
it. It is this ceaseless back-and-forth about articles that really makes
one wonder whether Wikipedia is an “encyclopedia” and its articles are
really “articles.” Might it not be more accurate to say that Wikipedia is a
never-ending discussion about everything, neatly topically arranged for
everyone’s convenience? And might not one say the same of the Internet
in general? What is it but a boundless forum for dialogue, discourse,
and conversation, for negotiation, cooperation, and collaboration, for
deliberation, disputation, and debate? Imagine a space so large as to
comfortably accommodate everyone in the world. A space in which
everyone is near everyone else, but no one can touch anyone. What do
you think people would do there? They’d talk, of course.
That is the “is” of the situation: people are going to use the Internet
to rapidly exchange messages about every possible subject and to every
possible end, even encyclopedia-writing. The “ought” developed to justify this behavior was a multipart form of deliberativism. The kernel of
this doctrine is Mill’s notion that deliberation is the best way to get to
the truth.75 It is almost universally held by “users.” Of course, there
are limits. Not every form of expression is deliberation. In Internetese,
“trolls” are those who enter into discussions just to provoke other
“users” and generally disrupt the deliberative process.76 Such people
sometimes get banned by moderators precisely for their disingenuousness. But in general, users and mods are willing to tolerate most anything
in the name of deliberation. More novel is the idea of a “beta” version,
or the “perpetual beta.” In software engineering, a beta is a version of
237

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

a program that has passed internal testing and is ready to be released to
“users” for further testing until it is ofﬁcially launched. The idea is that
the users will help perfect the software by ﬁnding things wrong with it
(“bugs”). This being so, the sooner you release the program to the users,
the less work you and your internal testers will have to do. So it makes
sense to “go live” as soon as possible.77 This attractive idea migrated to
other content on the Web, and soon many things – encyclopedia entries,
blog posts, comments of every kind – could be seen as betas awaiting
improvement by users. Peculiarly, this doctrine turned the meaning of
deliberation on its head in the name of more deliberation. Most people
would probably deﬁne “deliberation” as careful consideration, a kind
of slow weighing up or mulling over of some matter. But this is not
what happens in a beta release at all. Rather the opposite: ideas are put
up for “deliberation” before they have been carefully considered, and
they are subject to a kind of rapid-ﬁre, off-handed criticism that is more
akin to a water-cooler conversation than a true “deliberation.”
Range

When we talk about the Internet, we usually mean the World Wide
Web. The former is a system of pipes; the latter is one of the kinds of
data – HTML documents – that runs through the pipes. The distinction,
however, is now largely lost. Most people use the terms “Internet” and
“Web” synonymously. In a way, that’s good, because as a descriptor
“Internet” is obscure. It’s short for “Internetwork,” a non-word that
isn’t really much clearer. “Web” is much more telegraphic, as it is
metaphorically connected to things with which we are all familiar –
weaving, fabric, and even spiders. It’s easy to imagine the Internet as
a gigantic spider’s web blanketing the earth, connecting everything to
everything else through multiple, interconnected strands. Of course,
the “web” – in the generic sense of a communications network – is
not new. It was brought into being hundreds of thousands of years
ago the moment one human talked to another. Over time, humans
invented new media and used them to create new webs, each larger
than the last. They superimposed the new webs on the old: writing
on talking, print on writing, audiovisual media on print, and ﬁnally
the Internet – the Web – on audiovisual media. Although the Internet
web is probably larger geographically than the audiovisual web, the
238

HOMO SOMNIANS

two are very roughly the same size. You can retrieve HTML ﬁles from
servers all over the world; but you can also place calls all over the
world, listen to radio stations from all over the world, and watch TV
from all over the world. What really makes the Internet web different
from the audiovisual web is not its extent, but rather its density. The
Internet web is thicker, bushier, woollier than the audiovisual web.
More people are connected to more places at fewer removes more of
the time on the Internet than on, say, a telephone, radio, or TV web. This
relates to our previous discussion of channels. The Internet’s billions of
channels are “served” from computers all over the world. You can go
to any of them, any time. The audiovisual networks have thousands
of “broadcasts” from stations over most of the world. You can go to
some of them, some of the time. Audiovisual channels typically have
much larger audiences than Internet channels, but the coverage of the
Internet web as a whole is greater than that of the audiovisual web.
As the audiovisual channels themselves migrate to the Internet (socalled convergence), the superiority of the Web will become all the
greater.
The Internet, then, has global range and unexcelled coverage. It goes
everywhere and soon will reach everyone. Media with these characteristics engender extensive networks, which is to say networks that bring
diverse places and peoples together. According to our theory, extensive
networks diversify social practices and values evolved in and around
them. On extensive networks, strangers confront one another, learn
from one another, and assimilate one another to their worldviews. What
was smooth becomes rough, what was plain becomes mixed, what was
monochrome becomes multicolored. It’s not always pretty. Sometimes
this confrontation leads to conﬂict. But over extended periods of time
it often leads to the softening of edges and the acceptance of diversity.
There is no doubt that the Internet mixes things up in a new way.
Everything is there: every nationality, culture, language, dialect, creole;
every political viewpoint, economic theory, scientiﬁc school; every religious creed, spiritual belief, and ritual practice; every taste, aesthetic,
and sensibility; every ethic, moral code, and law. All and more are
found together on the Web. Some are real; some are imaginary. Some
are serious; some are silly. Some are sensible; some are so wacky as to
confound belief. But they are all there, each exactly one click away from
the other. The Web scotched the notion that people and things are the
239

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

same, or even similar, everywhere for good. But it also engendered a
new kind of voyeurism. In the Print and Audiovisual Eras, the presentation of documentary exotica – that is, depictions of the strange that
were uncontrived or “natural” – was enough to satisfy the curiosity of
most readers, listeners, and viewers. There seemed to always be more
of it, so what was on offer simply created anticipation for what came
next. The Internet, however, demonstrated that the well of “natural”
variation was not bottomless. In fact, it was quite ﬁnite, and that which
is ﬁnite and known is not as interesting as that which is inﬁnite and
unknown. The ﬁnitude of “natural” variation, then, created a desire
for what we might call “artiﬁcial” variation, that is, exotica that is
purposely contrived simply to surprise, astonish, or shock. Some of this
is benign, or at least relatively so, for example the “virtual worlds”
created by online gamers. But some of it is very disturbing, particularly
that which involves real people doing dangerous, degrading, or disgusting things simply for the sake of attention. You can see such material
in abundance on YouTube and any number of fetish porn sites.
That is the “is” of the situation: people are going to use the Web to
see everything there is – natural, imaginary, and contrived. The “ought”
we might call “transculturalism.” Recall that the doctrine of toleration
was born of the Print Era and multiculturalism of the Audiovisual Era.
Transculturalism moves beyond both by positing an identity that is
“beyond culture,” that is, envisions a kind of identity that is not rooted
in a historical culture (Russian, Vietnamese, or what have you) but
rather is an amalgam of many historical and invented cultures.78 Transculturalism might seem like a variation on Enlightenment “citizen of
the world” cosmopolitanism, and they are in fact similar. But transculturalism includes an element of self-fashioning that cosmopolitanism
did not. Transculturalism permits and even encourages the creation of
new sui generis identities. These include both ofﬂine and online selves,
the “real” as well as the “imaginary.” Identity is completely plastic
and any identity assumed is, so long as it does not obviously violate
the “harm principle,” acceptable. Perhaps the most familiar transnational identities are found in ofﬂine subcultures, such as bikers, goths,
skinheads, nudists, gangbangers, metalheads, hipsters, punks, skaters,
deadheads, hackers, hippies, trekkies, and so on.79 Since the Internet
makes it much easier to assume an identity than it is in the ofﬂine

240

HOMO SOMNIANS

world, we shouldn’t be shocked to learn that there are many more such
transnational subcultures (or “communities” as they are often called)
there.
Persistence

In spring 2007, Bear Stearns hedge-fund managers Ralph Ciofﬁ and
Matthew Tannin were pretty bullish about the prospects of the securities
they were hawking. At least that’s what they told the investors who
bought them. Secretly, however, they knew the funds were dogs. Tannin
told Ciofﬁ so in an email:
[T]he subprime market looks pretty damn ugly. . . . If we believe [our internal
modeling] is ANYWHERE CLOSE to accurate I think we should close the
funds now. The reason for this is that if [our internal modeling] is correct
then the entire subprime market is toast. . . . If AAA bonds are systematically
downgraded then there is simply no way for us to make money – ever.80

They didn’t close the funds – they kept on pitching. And they didn’t
make any money – ever. But they did get indicted on charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud. Thus, Ciofﬁ and Tannin joined
the ranks of Henry Blodget (Merrill Lynch), Jack Grubman (Citigroup),
Frank Quattrone (Credit Suisse First Boston), and other Wall Street
crooks who, while quite smart, forgot one of the basic rules of life on
the Internet: email is forever. So is most everything else on the Internet.
It’s not really the case that the Internet never forgets. It does. But it
remembers a heck of a lot.
The reason is twofold. First, it can. Unlike spoken words, writing,
printing on paper, and audiovisual signals on tape, digital ﬁles – the
kind that are stored on the Internet – can be copied and archived very
quickly, very accurately, and very cheaply. Practically speaking, there
is no limit to the amount of information that can be stored on the vast
array of devices that make up the Web. Second, we live in a world
where archiving information is the safe bet, at least most of the time.
You never know when you are going to need that document for some
purpose. So you archive it. Many people, however, are lazy about backing up their ﬁles. Horror stories abound. Don’t worry, though, there are
powerful organizations making sure that everything gets saved. Your

241

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

company, for example, has probably hired people to make sure that
its digital ﬁles are routinely archived. That includes the emails you
send from your work address. Then there are the folks at the Internet
Archive. They’ve been taking periodic “snapshots” of the Web since
1996 and making them available to the public. Although the Internet
Archive is not complete, it’s still awfully large. As of 2008, it contained
2,000 terabytes of data and over 85 billion web pages.81 According
to one estimate, an academic research library – the kind with millions
of books – holds about two terabytes.82 The print collection of the
Library of Congress, arguably the largest library in the world, contains
about 10 terabytes.83 And then there are all the private corporations
that record and archive what you do on the Internet in order to sell
you more soap. They do this using “tracking cookies” – little pieces
of software that are downloaded to your computer – that essentially
spy on you. Google’s cookies, for example, tell the main ofﬁce what
you searched for, when you searched, which of the results you selected,
and so on. They save it all, mix it up with other user data, crunch
it, and then use the results to try to ﬁgure out what sort of soap you
and people like you want. Then they sell advertising space on your
browser to your soap company. That’s a good trick. Just how long all
of this data will last we don’t exactly know, but it will probably be
a long time. The medium in which it is recorded doesn’t decay very
rapidly. The means used to read it – hardware, software – changes from
time to time, but engineers are for the most part pretty aware of the
need for “backward compatibility.” And the languages recorded are
very big and stable: English, Chinese, Japanese, etc. Besides, any ﬁle in
danger of becoming illegible due to decay, format obsolescence, or language change can be recopied, re-formatted, and translated. It wouldn’t
be surprising if the “snapshots” of the Internet taken by the Internet
Archive today were legible in 1,000 years. If we’re still here to read
them.
The Internet, then, is a persistent medium. It’s like a trillion elephants
all linked together in a sort of Vulcan mind-meld. Don’t forget that
next time you decide to bilk your investors out of their hard-earned
cash. Persistent media engender additive networks. These are networks
with a signiﬁcant capacity to accumulate information. Like your crazy
grandmother, they don’t throw anything away – they just put it in the

242

HOMO SOMNIANS

basement. According to our theory, additive networks will historicize
social practices and values developed in and around them. This means
that both awareness and the importance of the past will be heightened.
The past – represented in artifacts or imagined – will be in a constant
dialogue with the present.
In the previous chapter, we saw how audiovisual media engendered the practice of pervasive (and often intrusive) documentation.
The Internet continues this trend. Since at least 1996, the Internet has
been recording a good percentage of the new spoken, written, printed,
recorded, photographed, or ﬁlmed messages that passed over it. Thus,
it comprises a remarkable record of what we have done online for the
past decade or so. But just as signiﬁcantly, the Web is assimilating the
pre-Internet past as well. For well over a decade now, institutions of
every shape, size, and purpose have busied themselves with the digitization and posting of artifacts that were not “born digital.” The scope
of this project is mind boggling: every government record, every corporate record, every clerical record – pretty much everything ever written,
printed, or photographed by an agency of one sort or another. Google
and a consortium of academic libraries alone plan to scan and make
available somewhere around 32 million books.84 This may seem like
a lot of information, but it may be exceeded as individuals and their
families get into the act. People are already scanning and uploading
their family photo albums to the Web. It won’t be long before they
begin to scan old letters, personal paper, and even the family Bible.
Like some enormous gravitational force, the Internet is sucking the past
into its vast memory banks. That digitized past will be afﬁxed to the
ever-expanding present of born-digital information, at which point the
“what came before” will be one seamless digital archive.
The Internet will enable us to preserve more of the past than ever
before. It will also expand the capacity for mass surveillance by creating
a vast permanent record for every “user.”85 Every email you send,
every post you make, every site you visit, every search you conduct,
every proﬁle you view, every article you read, every ﬁle you download, every ﬁle you upload – all of it can be recorded and stored for
“later reference.” And it’s not only your online behavior that will ﬁnd
its way online. All of the “real world” records you generate will be there
as well: your commute times, your arrival and departure from work,

243

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

your credit card purchases, all of your other bills, your phone records,
and all those video surveillance tapes that you appear on. Interestingly,
none of this – or almost none of it – is Big Brother’s doing. We are
active participants in the creation and maintenance of the permanent
record machine. We don’t mind the cookies, we like the nifty transaction
records, and we feel safer because of the security cameras. Of course,
the collectors of this information assure us that it is secure and will
never be used for nefarious purposes. Not everyone is convinced.86
The creation of the electronic dossier has lead, predictably enough,
to an expansion of the practice of “reputation management.” In the
Audiovisual Era, corporations used reputation management in order to
protect their brands.87 They needed to do this because they were public
entities and were, therefore, closely watched. Any misstep could cost
them dearly. In the Internet Era, everybody needs to practice reputation
management because everyone is a public entity and is closely watched.
You, so the business gurus say, are a brand.88 If you let someone sully
your image, you may not be able to clean it up. That, of course, could
cost you dearly. So you need to monitor and perhaps even edit, say, your
Wikipedia entry to make sure that it tells your version of the truth. But
don’t get caught managing your reputation in this way, for that in itself
could damage your reputation.89
That is the “is” of the situation: people will, whether they know it
or not, use the Internet to create electronic dossiers on everything and
everyone. The “ought” that attended this behavior is an odd variation
on temporalism that could be called “passive vigilism.” Recall that the
Audiovisual Era saw the development of vigilism, that is, the notion
that we should record and archive ongoing events as they happen,
both so that we can enjoy re-viewing them and can use them in forensic
contexts. Being vigil in this way was an active process. We had to record
the sounds and visions, store them, and then search through them in case
we needed something from them. Being vigil on the Internet, however,
is a passive process. We don’t really collect and store data; rather,
“data are collected and stored.” We don’t make the universal archive
of electronic dossiers; rather, it seems to simply “appear” as if by itself.
This, so we say, is generally ﬁne because it makes things very convenient
(it’s nice when a website knows your name and credit card number) and
safe (should anyone misbehave, we can “go back in time” and catch
them).
244

Searchability

The ability to store a lot of information is useless if you can’t ﬁnd
anything in it. As we’ve said, written, print, and audiovisual archives
can be quite capacious, but it’s hard to ﬁnd anything in them. The reason
is that we don’t have a special tool we can use to look through the data –
all we have are our eyes and ears, and they were designed to do other
things. In contrast, computers, which can store even more information,
do have a specialized tool to search for data in their archives – the ﬁnd
command or something similar. As everyone knows, computers store
all their data as zeros and ones – the two digits in “digital.” The ﬁnd
command tells the computer to go through data looking for a speciﬁc
series of these zeros and ones. Functionally speaking, this is no different
than you looking for a string of characters on a page, in a book, or
in a library. The difference is that the computer can do the operation
really, really fast. We can’t. Since we can’t, we construct indexes: tables
of one sort or another that tell us where the information we want
is. Computers do the same thing – they just do it much faster and
arguably better. Librarians laboriously construct indexes – catalogues –
that tell us where every book in the library is. By analogy, the computer
automatically constructs an index that tells it where every word in every
book in the library is, as well as where many possible combinations
of words are. In a sense, a search engine works like a computer. It
“crawls” across the Internet gathering information and then uses that
information to construct a massive index. When you tell the engine
to ﬁnd something – such as a string of characters like “William” – it
mechanically looks through the indexes and return addresses – URLs –
to web pages that you might want.
The crucial term here is “might,” for given that your search term is
probably short and the index is very large, you are probably going to
get a lot of URLs that have nothing to do with what you are actually
searching for. If your intention in searching the string “William” was to
get web pages about William Shakespeare, you might be disappointed.
The engine could return a lot about “William” and only a little, if any,
about William Shakespeare. Here, however, the search engine has an
advantage over the personal computer, because it can anticipate what
you were looking for even when you were vague, as in the previous
example. It does this by comparing your behavior to everyone else’s. We
245

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

noted that a search engine records all the strings everyone searches and
what they select after the results are returned. This enables it to compile
a ranking based on click-through rate. If it turns out that many people
who search the string “William” click a link having to do with William
Shakespeare, then the search engine will respond to your “William”
query by presenting you with William Shakespeare pages on the sensible
presumption that you are more or less like everyone else. Since you are,
you will get what you want despite the fact that you were vague. Clickthrough rate is only one of the factors that the search engine can consider
when deciding how to rank URLs returned. It might also consider the
amount of trafﬁc a site gets, the number of inbound links a site has, the
amount of time people spend on a site, the number of pages they look at
on a site, or the rate at which they return to the site. All of these factors
are packed together in a search algorithm, a kind of formula the engine
uses to guess what you are really looking for when you type “William”
into the search box. The results can be sort of spooky, because the
search engine seems to know something about you that you didn’t tell
it. That’s because it does.
The Internet is a supremely searchable medium. Unlike, say, the
British Library, its doors are always open. Unlike the British Library,
it has a remarkably detailed index. Unlike the British Library, its index
can be searched with blinding speed. And, unlike the British Library,
the search results are highly relevant and the materials themselves are
immediately accessible. It’s no wonder that the British Library and every
other library on earth is rushing to put its holdings online. Searchable
media generate mapped networks, that is, ones that have a ﬁne-grained
address system that allows users to locate archived items easily. These
sorts of networks amateurize social practices developed in and around
them. By allowing anyone the ability to ﬁnd and retrieve what they need
to know, they blunt the attempts of “experts” to monopolize special
knowledge and use it as a basis for professionalization. The line between
amateurs and experts thus becomes blurred.
The Internet is blurring this line remarkably quickly. Only a quarter
century ago, if you wanted to learn something speciﬁc and specialized
on your own, you were going to have a hard time doing it. Most people
didn’t have access to those great repositories of knowledge, academic
research libraries. Even if they managed to get in, they probably didn’t
have the background knowledge to ﬁnd what they wanted and, more
246

HOMO SOMNIANS

important, needed. And even if they located it in a book or article, they
wouldn’t likely be able to retrieve it without special permission. None
of that is true today. If the Internet has not already supplanted the
academic research library as the primary archive of knowledge, it soon
will. In some cases, the institutions that control these repositories are
themselves abetting this process of democratization, as in the case of
the consortium of libraries that have joined the Google Books project.90
In other cases, they are resistant, as in the case of many academic
publishers. In the end, it won’t matter because the information will
“leak” out of these sources through multiple channels. The same forces
that are pushing copyright-protected audiovisual materials onto the
Internet will force copyright-protected intellectual materials there as
well. They may not be in a form that can easily be traced or recognized,
for example in Wikipedia entries or on blog posts, but the substance
will be the same. You can be pretty sure that what you need to know
is somewhere on the Internet. To ﬁnd it, all you will need is some
“Googlefu” – the ability to use a search engine efﬁciently – and a search
engine.91 You may not know exactly what you need to know – that is,
be faced with what former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
called an “unknown unknown.”92 The search engines, however, know
what people like you typically need to know and will lead you in that
direction. If this “wisdom of crowds” technique fails, you can rely on
the wisdom of individuals to tell you what you need. There are, as we’ve
already noted, thousands of communities of interest on the Internet in
which real people are trading knowledge of every kind, from how to
deal with cancer to how to get a date. On these sites you can ask very
general or very speciﬁc questions and receive tailored advice. If you
don’t learn what you need here, then you can take a ﬁnal step and
ask an expert directly. There are countless thousands of credentialed
experts on the Web who are giving away advice. They do it for various
reasons: because they want attention, because it makes them feel good,
because they are bored. The remarkable thing is that they are there and
will provide you a professional service for free.
That is the “is” of the situation: people will use the Internet to ﬁnd
out what they need to know, or at least what they think they need
to know. The “ought” developed to justify this behavior is a species
of individualism that goes under the odd name “prosumerism.” The
word is a portmanteau of the words “producer” and “consumer” and
247

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

means, broadly, a person who is involved in both the production and
consumption of a product. The term was coined in this sense by the
Futurist Alvin Tofﬂer in 1980, but wasn’t used with reference to the
Internet until the mid-1990s.93 The core idea in online prosumerism
is that there really shouldn’t be any separate “producers” and “consumers”; rather, everyone should be a “collaborator.” By extension,
prosumerism suggests that there shouldn’t be any “experts” and “amateurs”; rather, there should just be people who know different things
and are willing to combine them in various ways for the good of all.
This philosophy was anticipated by the Free Software Movement in
the 1980s; it was formalized by Open Source Initiative in the 1990s;
it was adopted by Wikipedia in the early 2000s; and it is the credo
of those who champion “user-generated content” today.94 Those who
oppose it charge “anti-elitism.”95 Proponents of prosumerism dismiss
these charges as “whining” issuing from the “reactionary core of the
academy.”96

People have been waiting for virtual reality for years. They needn’t wait
any longer, because it’s here. It’s not an immersive environment, but
rather a set of web pages through which we can “live.” On these web
pages we can chat up strangers, go on dates, have sex. We can read
books, watch movies, and play games. We can go to museums, visit
foreign countries, or land on the moon. We can go to school, do our
work, and get paid. We can buy stuff, sell stuff, and trade stuff. We can
be professors, lawyers, and doctors, or at least “know” what they know.
We can do all this and never leave our seat in front of the computer.
Of course, as Plato would point out, it’s all a sort of illusion, for none
of it gets to the essence of things, none of it is True. Nonetheless, it
has many real-world implications, some of which we have tried to ﬂesh
out in this chapter. The Internet is a new medium, but it is a medium
all the same. As such, it has physical attributes that permit people to
use it in certain ways and prevent them from using it in others. These
logistical characteristics, we argued, predictably led to the formation
of certain sorts of media networks, and these media networks in turn
engendered speciﬁc social practices and values. Table 6 summarizes all
that has come before.

It goes without saying that the Internet doesn’t necessarily engender
the effects listed and, when it does, engender them in the same degree.
The Internet’s effects could be buffered or even eliminated altogether
with enough effort. Call to mind a society in which only a few have
access to the Internet – a kind of cyber-priesthood. Now imagine that
this low-access Internet has some odd and rather un-Internety characteristics: it can only be used in public, so that everyone knows who and
what is being transmitted; it can only send text, and not very much of
it, very quickly, or very far; its transmissions disappear without a trace
shortly after receipt; since it has no archive, it can’t be searched at all.
All this is technically feasible. But realistically it cannot and will not
ever be done, at least not all of it. Most of the world’s nations seem to
have learned the lesson taught by print and audiovisual media: media
will do what media do, and attempting to go against their grain will
probably lead to nothing but trouble and failure. This acceptance is
one of the reasons the Internet is now virtually everywhere, and virtually everywhere the same. There are nations that have not learned
this lesson. They are uniformly the last remaining illiberal, undemocratic, tyrannies left on the planet. And – with the exception of those
that almost completely block access to the Internet – none of them
is succeeding in bending the Internet to its will, at least to any great
degree. Moreover, where they have succeeded, we can be reasonably
sure they will eventually fail, and suffer for their failure. For the Internet will do there what the Internet has naturally done everywhere else. It
will spread until almost everyone has it and everyone believes everyone
should have it. It will foster the formation of many private groups and

249

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

a belief that individuals have the natural-born right to opt in or out of
these groups. It will be used primarily for pleasure and without penalty
or shame. It will engender dialogues both within and between groups
at a level heretofore unimaginable, and it will lead to a general (though
not necessarily laudable) democratization of everything. It will grow to
include everyone, everywhere, and thereby break down barriers. It will
save everything, make everything saved ﬁndable, and thereby make us
at once vulnerable and knowledgeable.
This, then, is Internet Culture, brought into being by the Web and
the organized interests that “pulled” it into existence. Whether its run
will be long and whether it will be good for humanity, we do not know.
In the next and ﬁnal chapter, we will consider just these questions.

250

CONCLUSION

the media and human
well-being

In our days, everything seems pregnant with its contrary: machinery, gifted with
the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labor, we behold
starving and overworking it.1
– Karl Marx, 1856

Marx worshiped technology. Thanks to labor-saving machines, he predicted, one day we would all be free to “hunt in the morning, ﬁsh in
the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner.”2 One
day, but not in his day. Marx looked around his mid-nineteenth century
world and saw, much to his horror, that capitalists were using the technical instruments of emancipation to bind their fellow men. “At the
same pace that mankind masters nature,” he wrote, “man seems to
become enslaved to other men.”3 The problem was not the tools. They
had “revolutionized industrial production,” thereby setting the stage
for a new epoch of human fulﬁllment.4 The problem was the way we –
humanity – used these tools. Marx told a story of technical progress, and
so have we. He described the “forces of production” marching to ever
greater heights, and we have described the “forces of communication”
doing the same. But Marx, as we’ve seen, was careful to distinguish
technical progress from moral progress. He saw a lot of the former and
very little of the latter. We would be remiss not to make the same distinction. It may seem obvious to us that each successive media – writing,
print, audiovisual devices, and the Internet – has been “better” than the
last. In a technical sense, this is true. But in an ethical sense, the case
is much less sure. A tool is only as good as the purposes to which we
put it. It seems only ﬁtting, then, that we conclude our consideration of
251

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

the media by asking whether we have been using them to improve our
well-being or not.5
In order to answer this question, we need to be rather speciﬁc about
what we mean by “improve our well-being.” That is not easy. People
have been arguing about just what makes people “happy” – to put
a word on it – for millennia. More than 2,000 years ago, Aristotle,
who proposed his own theory on the subject, noted there was a lot of
disagreement about just what happiness is.6 There’s just as much today.7
Is it better to be an unhappy Socrates or a happy pig?8 To answer that
question, you’d have to know what happiness is, and nobody seems to
know. You’d also have to talk to a pig, and nobody seems to know how
to do that, either.
It’s much easier to say when happiness – whatever it might be –
is likely to arise. There is general agreement on this score. If we are
starved, tormented, or guilt-ridden, we probably aren’t going to be
happy; if we are well-fed, joy-ﬁlled, and guilt-free, we are quite likely
to be happy. This being so, we can say with some conﬁdence that the
conditions under which happiness is most likely to materialize are at
least three. The ﬁrst condition is material well-being, that is, being wellfed, clothed, and sheltered. The second is sensory well-being, that is,
feeling – in the physical sense – good. The third is spiritual well-being,
that is, having a sense that we are acting rightly in relation to our fellows
and the universe. In what follows, we will use this simple measure to
see whether the media have improved our lot or not.

the media and material well-being
Have the media improved the material well-being of humankind? The
answer is “yes.” We know this, as we will explain, because (a) we
know that we are much better off, materially speaking, than we were
even 100 years ago – standards of living have risen; (b) we know why
we are better off – improved economic productivity; and (c) we know
why economic productivity has improved – improved tools, media
among them.
In purely material terms, we live in a golden age. Our ancestors’
lives may have been nasty, brutish, and short, but ours are likely to be
pleasant, reﬁned, and long, at least by comparison. In the year AD 1, the
average person earned the equivalent of about $500 per year; today he
252

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

or she earns more than $7,000.9 Moreover, the rate of income growth
has been quickening over the long haul. Not only do we earn more
each year, but the size of our annual raise is increasing. What’s most
remarkable about this boom is that it occurred despite an explosion in
world population. In the year AD 1, there were roughly 170 million
people on earth; in the year 2000, there were more than six billion.
And the rate of population growth is also increasing: not only are there
more of us each year, but the size of the annual bump is growing
as well.
The simultaneous rise of income and population may seem odd.
After all, you might think that more pie-eaters would mean less pie
per person. That’s the way it works around the dinner table, anyway.
But it’s not the way it works in long-term economic history: more pieeaters meant more pie per person. The number of pie-eaters grew, but
the amount of pie grew faster. And not only that: the rate at which
pie-eaters and pie has grown has itself been rising. There can really
be only one explanation for this odd occurrence: people are getting
better at making pies, and the rate at which they are getting better is
accelerating.
Why? There are several ways to raise economic productivity, but the
best – or at least most powerful in the long term – is to improve the
tools you use to make pies. The other “inputs” – labor and capital –
don’t increase productivity as well because they are subject to severely
diminishing returns. Adding bakers might increase the number of pies
produced per baker for a while, but eventually it won’t. Adding more
pie capital to the production process might increase the number of
pies baked per unit of capital, but eventually it won’t. Adding better
technology – and here we mean tools and know-how in the broadest
sense – will deﬁnitely increase productivity, and it will do so in an openended fashion. Technology is the only economic gift that seems to keep
on giving. Using better tools, the same number of bakers can take the
same amount of pie capital and make more pie.
Technology has been driving improved productivity for a very long
time. We know this, surprisingly enough, because of the increase in
global population itself. Prior to the demographic transition in the
nineteenth century, people almost always turned extra food into extra
progeny. They didn’t save and consume more like we do; they had
more babies. For this reason, premodern populations usually hovered

around their carrying capacity, that is, they “carried” as many children
as they could, given available labor, capital, and technology. Since labor
and capital are generally subject to diminishing returns, only enhanced
technology can increase carrying capacity in the long term. Thus, when
we see a population increase over a very long period of time, the only
explanation can be improved tools and the enhanced productivity that
comes of them. The fact that premodern population is a proxy for the
premodern technological level means (a) that the degree to which the
population increases is a measure of improvement in technology; and
(b) that the rate at which it increases is a measure of the rate of that
improvement. As we’ve seen, the worldwide human population has
risen and the rate at which it is rising has been accelerating. Thus, we
can say with conﬁdence that the level of technology has risen and the
rate at which that level is rising is accelerating.
Population is an indirect measure of technical level and growth rate.
But we also have a direct measure, the production and accumulation of
new technologies themselves. According to a recent catalogue of “great
discoveries and inventions,” we began our journey ages ago with a
handful of really useful tools; by 2000, we had about 8,500.10 Much of
this increase in our tool stock is the product of accumulation: when our
ancestors invented something useful, they remembered it and passed it
on.11 But much more of it has to do with a rising rate of innovation
over time.
For the ﬁrst 150,000 years of human existence, the species-wide rate
of innovation per year was the tiniest fraction above zero; now it’s
around 50 innovations per year. Over the long term, the rate of innovation has therefore grown exponentially. Aside from alien visitation,
there can only be three explanations for the rising all-human rate of
innovation over time: (a) there are more of us innovating now than then
(more innovators meaning more innovations); (b) each of us is individually more innovative now than then (better innovators meaning more
innovations); or (c) some combination of (a) and (b). The right explanation is clearly (c). As we’ve seen, there are indeed a lot more of us innovating now than then: 7,000 years ago there were perhaps ﬁve million
people on earth; now there are billions.12 We are also better innovators.
Around 10,000 years ago, the rate of innovation per year per billion people was 0.75; now it’s 6.68.13 If one focuses on people in the developed

world – that is, where most of the innovation is accomplished – then
the increase in per capita rate of innovation is much greater.
Of course, not all innovations are the same. Some are important –
the plow – and others less so – the letter opener. In the former category,
we should put those technologies – or rather sets of technologies – that
spawn new modes of production and discontinuously greater productivity. These epochal technologies and the epochs they brought are not
hard to identify. There have been ﬁve of them.
1. The “Behavioral Revolution” circa 50,000 BC to 10,000 BC.
So-called because of the emergence of “behaviorally modern
humans,” that is, humans just like you and me.14 In this period,
the rate of innovation rose from 0.0001 innovations per year
to 0.0033 innovations per year. The annual average growth rate
was 0.06 percent, meaning the number of innovations would double roughly every 1,167 years. During this era, we perfected old
stone tools (e.g., blades and hand axes) and created many new
ones (e.g., bows, arrows, spears, buttons, awls, needles, grinding
implements, ornaments, ﬁgurines, paintings) out of new materials
(bone, antler, ivory, shells, pigments).15
2. The “Agricultural Revolution” circa 10,000 BC to AD 1000. Socalled because of the introduction of crop cultivation and animal
husbandry.16 In this period, the rate of innovation rose from 0.006
innovations per year to 0.295 innovations per year. The annual
average growth rate was 0.44 percent, meaning the number of
innovations would double about every 159 years. During this
era, we perfected or invented the plow and the sickle, bricks and
mortar, the spindle and the loom, the yoke and the harness, mining
and metallurgy, and writing and papyrus.17
3. The “Capitalist Revolution” circa AD 1000 to AD 1700. Socalled because of the growth of market-oriented production and
trade, predominantly in Europe.18 In this period, the rate of innovation rose from 0.52 innovations per year to 4.85 innovations per
year. The average annual growth rate was 1.19 percent, meaning
the number of innovations would double about every 59 years.
During this era we perfected or invented stirrups, heavy plows,
waterwheels, ﬂywheels, windmills, modern ship rigging, pumps,

258

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

compasses, clocks, guns, printing presses, calculating machines,
other very useful tools.19
4. The “Industrial Revolution” circa AD 1700 to AD 1940. Socalled because of the introduction of artiﬁcially powered production and trade. In this period, the rate of innovation rose from
5.8 innovations per year to 30.2 innovations per year. The average annual growth rate was 1.75 percent, meaning the number
of innovations would double every 40 years. During this era,
we perfected or invented all manner of energy sources (coal, oil,
atomic), energy transmission devices (railroads, cars, electricity),
engines (steam, internal combustion, electric), and built them into
machines of every kind.
5. The “Information Revolution” circa AD 1940 to Present. Socalled because of the introduction of artiﬁcially powered control
of production and trade. In this period, the rate of innovation
rose from 22 innovations per year to 40 innovations per year
(and rising). The average annual growth rate was 1.36 percent,
meaning the number of innovations doubles ever 51 years. During
this era, we perfected or invented all manner of information storage, transmission, and manipulation machines, particularly the
computer.
What do these ﬁve periods have in common? Two things.
First, during each of them the productivity, population, and the innovation rate grew together. The reason for this united upswing is obvious:
productivity, population, and innovation are all part of what might be
called the “growth cycle,” a positive feedback loop in which each trend
stimulated the others and they all grew together. The logic is simple:
new tools often allow people to produce more food; more food permits
people to produce more people; more people are more likely to produce
more new tools.20
The second thing these ﬁve eras share is that each gave birth to a new,
more powerful medium. This, of course, is no coincidence. As we’ve
seen, each new set of economic conditions caused organized interests
to search out, re-engineer, and deploy new media technologies. They
did not always do so for economic reasons, but it’s easy to see that the
result was a mighty contribution to economic growth. The argument

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

here is very straightforward. As we’ve said, different media create different kinds of networks. Some of these are more conducive to economic
activity than others. Compare, for example, a speech network and an
Internet network. The speech network will be connected – everyone
will be privy to everyone else’s messages; symbolic – messages will be
encoded; constrained – messages will be short; intensive – there will
only be a relative few nodes in the network; and substitutive – messages
will not accumulate very well. You hardly need to be a professional
economist to see that literally none of these characteristics has a positive impact on economic activity. New technologies and know-how can
be exchanged, but only in a small circle. If they require privacy, they cannot be exchanged. If they require graphics, they cannot be exchanged.
If they are too large, they cannot be exchanged. If they are complicated, they will be forgotten and therefore cannot be exchanged. Such a
network has few of the “network externalities” – like radically increasing returns to network scale – and “knowledge spillover effects” –
like cross-fertilization among enterprises – that specialists claim are the
engines of long-term economic growth.21 Now compare an Internet
network. It is segmented – messages can be hidden or shared; iconic –
messages can be pictures and words; unconstrained – messages can be
very small or very large; extensive – messages can reach a few people or
millions; and additive – messages can be saved for later reference. All
of these attributes contribute to economic activity. New technologies
and best practices can be widely exchanged, made public or private,
rendered in any form, transmitted in any size, and archived forever. As
such, an Internet network has a host of “network externalities” and
“spillovers.”
In truth, we did not really begin to beneﬁt materially from better
media and better networks until quite recently. This is because, as we’ve
said, until recently we used the fruits of higher productivity to produce
additional fruits from our loins. Increased productivity doesn’t do you
much good if it only leads to increased re-productivity. Of course, the
ruling classes, as Marx would say, have always enjoyed a better standard
of living than those they ruled. They could have as many children as they
wanted and still enjoy more stuff. The rest of us, however, probably
lived no better in AD 1800 than we had in 3000 BC. We just had more
children. That changed, as we’ve said, in the mid-nineteenth century,
when we stopped turning additional stuff into additional children and
261

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

started turning additional stuff into additional stuff. The reason we
did so, like any change of heart, remains something of a mystery. But
it is not unconnected with the evolution of the media themselves. To
understand how these two phenomena – the demographic transition
and the development of the media – are connected, we need to address
the role the media have played (or not played) in enhancing our sensory
well-being.

media and sensory well-being
Have the media made us feel, in the purely sensory sense, any better?
The answer again is “yes.” We know this, as we will presently explain,
because (a) we know that variety – or rather safe novelty – is the spice
of life; (b) we know that we produce a lot more safe novelty than ever
before; (c) we know why that volume of safe novelty has increased –
improved novelty productivity; and (d) we know why novelty productivity has improved – improved tools, media among them.
Measuring changes in material well-being is simple because all you
need do is count materials. Measuring changes in sensory well-being
is more difﬁcult because it’s not at all clear what you should count,
or even if there is anything to count. Lots of different things make us
feel good. Some are purely physical: sleep, drugs, and sex. Others are
abstract: achievement, friendship, and beauty. And still others seem to
fall between the two: music, humor, and drama. Alas, none of these
things is universally enjoyed – De gustibus non est disputandum – and
most of them can’t really be counted – how much “beauty” is there in
a rose? We might say that they are, or at least most of them, consumed
during “leisure time” and then use leisure hours as a proxy for the
amount of sensual well-being. But that won’t quite work because many
people derive a great deal of pleasure from their work, and work hours
would be completely excluded.
One thing that all of these stimuli have in common, however, is
that they are subject to diminishing returns.22 For whatever reason,
people seem to naturally enjoy novelty.23 We have all experienced “too
much of a good thing.” You drink too much, and you get a hangover.
You hang out with your friends too often, and you get tired of them.
You watch too much TV, and you get bored. In such situations you
need a “change of pace,” something new and different. Of course,
262

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

new and different can be dangerous. But if it’s demonstrably safe, then
you will, upon reaching the point of diminishing returns with your
current sensual diversion, probably opt for it if it is available at low
cost.24
This being so, the thing we want to count when measuring long-term
sensory well-being is safe novelty. How much safe novelty is there? Is
there more of it today than there was yesterday? How fast is the amount
of it changing? The best way to begin answering these questions is to
measure the root of all novelty, that is, variety. We might think of
variety as potential novelty: the greater the variety available, the more
novelty one can potentially experience. Which is simply to say that, in
order to experience new things, you need new things.
There would seem to be no question that the amount of variety – or
at least the kind of variety that might interest humans – has increased
mightily since we evolved 180,000 years ago. Over the past 70,000
years we, Homo sapiens sapiens, migrated from one place (Africa) to
places all over the globe. The stock of geographic variety thereby grew.
Over the same period, we transformed a single culture into thousands
of different cultures, each quite different from the other. Thus, the stock
of cultural variety grew. Over the past 10,000 years, we transformed
a simple agricultural society with a few roles into an incredibly diverse
industrial society with tens of thousands of roles. The stock of social
variety thereby grew. Over the past 500 years, we have employed professionals – explorers, scientists, scholars – to analyze and catalogue
the natural universe. Thus, the stock of natural variety grew. Over
the past 200 years we have employed another class of professionals –
artists, writers, entertainers – to imagine ﬁctive worlds. Thus, the stock
of imaginary variety grew.
So we clearly have more variety than we once did. But not only that:
the rate at which we are producing variety is increasing and has been
for some time. We know this because the rate of variety-production is
a function of several other kinds of production, all of whose rates are
increasing. We have already reviewed three of them: the production of
stuff, the production of people, and the production of innovations. Rising rates of productivity allowed us to produce more stuff with fewer
resources. Given that we like novelty, more stuff also meant different
stuff. So rising productivity created more variety. Rising rates of population growth meant more people each year. Since everyone is different,
263

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

more people meant more different people. So rising rates of population growth created more variety. Rising rates of innovation meant
more innovations each year. Because innovations are by deﬁnition new,
more innovations means more different tools. So rising rates of innovation created more variety. We hardly need add that since productivity,
population, and innovation are part of a positive feedback loop – the
economic growth cycle – their upward movement drives the general rate
of variety-production. If the one grew exponentially, so did the other.
The reason all of these trends grew together at roughly the same rate
is, of course, improved technology. As we said, only improved tools can
increase productivity – be it of stuff or variety – indeﬁnitely.
All of this means that both the level of variety and rate of variety production have been increasing for some time. But variety is not novelty,
it is only potential novelty; potential novelty doesn’t contribute to our
sensory well-being, only actual novelty does. There might be a lot of
variety “out there,” but if you can’t get to it or have it brought to you,
then it might as well not exist. Here is where media work their unique
magic, for they can transform variety into novelty. Not, of course, by
moving you to whatever difference might exist (we still haven’t cracked
that problem), but rather by bringing whatever variety other people
might experience to you. You aren’t a very good recording device, but
the media are. You aren’t easy to reproduce, but the media are. You
aren’t very mobile, but the media are. The media enable you to record,
reproduce, and distribute your experiences of variety to others, thereby
transforming potential novelty into actual novelty. The media, so to
speak, put us all in each other’s heads.
Of course they did so to different degrees, largely depending on
their technical attributes and the networks that ﬂow from them. Compare, for example, manuscript writing and the Internet. The writing
network will be concentrated – most people won’t even be fully on it
because of the high cost of learning to read and write well; symbolic –
messages will be encoded; constrained – messages will be short; monologic – messages will move slowly; and unmapped – messages will be
hard to ﬁnd. Clearly, a written network is not a very efﬁcient (or fun)
way to exchange experiences. If experience-bearing messages must be
read, only a minority of the audience will receive them. If they require
pictures or sounds, they cannot be exchanged. If they are long, they
cannot be exchanged. If they need to arrive quickly, they cannot be

exchanged. If they are archived, they cannot be found and therefore
cannot be exchanged. Now let’s look at an Internet network. It is diffuse – everyone can get it; iconic – messages can include words, pictures,
and sounds; unconstrained – messages can be long; dialogic – messages
will move rapidly; and mapped – messages will be easy to ﬁnd. The
Internet is a marvelous tool for exchanging experiences. Experiencebearing messages can be widely distributed and easily understood; they
can be text, pictures, or sound; they can be as short or long as you
like; they will arrive quickly; and, if lost, they can be recovered simply.
There is no question that the Internet is a machine for turning variety
into novelty. It reveals the whole of the universe of human experiences.
When we surf it, we are surﬁng through each other’s senses.
It took a long time to get there, though. During the ﬁrst 6,000 years
of artiﬁcial media – roughly 3000 BC to AD 1850 – it remained very
difﬁcult to share experiences of variety. Writing, as we’ve just said, is a
poor tool for trading experience, if only for the fact that in premodern
times so few people could read and write. Print is somewhat better, but
is only as good as the number of people on the print network, that is,
the number of people who can produce, send, receive, and understand
printed messages. The European Print Revolution may have been revolutionary, but it did not immediately bring a revolution in literacy: prior
to 1800, the majority of Europeans – and the vast majority outside the
Northwestern region – could not read or write. Long after Gutenberg,
Europeans shared their experiences by talking, just as people had done
for millennia. That changed in the nineteenth century, when governments got into the business of compelling people to become literate and
the printing industry got into the business of producing for the masses
of new readers. At the beginning of the century, a smallish minority
of all Europeans could read; by the end of it, a large majority could.25
At the beginning of the century, printed matter was relatively rare; by
the end of it, it was in the hands of pretty much everyone who wanted
it. Millions of readers and billions of texts meant the democratization of experience. The appearance of the audiovisual media and the
Internet in the twentieth century accelerated and ampliﬁed this process.
They allowed more experiences of different kinds to ﬂow more rapidly
through even larger networks. For the ﬁrst time in human history, we
began to enter each other’s heads, to surf through each other’s senses
in very large numbers.
266

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

One can’t help but notice an interesting parallel between the timing
of the take-off of material well-being – the nineteenth century – and the
timing of the take off of sensory well-being – the nineteenth century.
This simultaneity is no accident, for they are both part of the same selfreinforcing system. We saw that the material well-being of Europeans
(and, later, everyone else) began to improve when fertility began to
decline. Thereafter, the economic pie continued to grow at a rapid pace
while the number of pie-eaters, though still increasing, advanced at a
slower pace. As a result, everybody got a bigger share of the growing
pie. But what triggered the decline in fertility? This is an old question.
Indeed, it ﬁnds its origins in the nineteenth century itself, when anxious
upper-class intellectuals such as Francis Galton – Darwin’s cousin –
began to worry that “desirables” were being swamped, demographically speaking, by “undesirables.”26 We, of course, are interested in the
unexpected decline of European fertility for a different reason, namely,
as a condition for modern economic growth. It has not been neglected.
Indeed, scholars have answered the question almost too well. In hundreds of books and thousands of papers, they have discovered dozens
of factors that impelled Europeans and those who followed them down
the path to modernity to have fewer children. Among the most common we ﬁnd: declining mortality, increasing longevity, rising incomes,
urbanization, inheritance laws, anti-child labor laws, tax laws, increasing return to education, mass education, improved contraception, the
women’s movement, secularism, liberalism, socialism, and – that maker
of all things modern – capitalism.27
Another factor, and one of particular interest to us, is access to
media. Since the 1990s, researchers have devoted considerable attention to the impact of exposure to mass media to the ongoing decline
in fertility in the semi- and undeveloped worlds.28 This is particularly
fortunate for us, as these modern-day scholars are in fact closely observing a process quite similar to that which went on in nineteenth-century
Europe during the ﬁrst, pivotal fertility decline. Their conclusion is this:
when access to media goes up, fertility goes down.29 Even when other
fertility-inﬂuencing factors are considered (for example, level of education, urban residence, occupation), the statistical association between
media exposure and lower fertility remains signiﬁcant.30
Of course, correlation is not causation: in order for the former
to indicate the latter, we need to identify a probable mechanism or
267

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

mechanisms. These are not hard to imagine. Having children takes
time and money; anything that reduces the amount of time or money
that can or will be devoted to child-bearing and -rearing will reduce
fertility.31 Media demand time and money, both directly and indirectly.
Letter-writing, book-reading, radio-listening, television-watching, and
Internet-surﬁng are all “time sucks,” as we sometimes say. If the time
sucked is right before you and your conjugal partner fall asleep, it
might well have a direct impact on your fertility. Late-night television
is a kind of birth control. Moreover, since the media aren’t exactly
given away, they are also “money sucks,” though we don’t say so in
so many words. Money spent on media is money that you can’t spend
on your children, notional or actual. A big-screen TV is also a kind of
birth control. The probable indirect temporal and monetary costs of
media are much greater than the direct costs. The reason is simple: the
media show you variety, that is, potential novelty. You are physically
here, in this familiar space. The media take you mentally there, into an
exotic space full of possibilities. That process of mental transportation
is enjoyable enough in itself, as anyone who has read a mystery novel
cover-to-cover in a single sitting, watched ten hours of a Twilight Zone
marathon, or played “World of Warcraft” until dawn will tell you. But
the media also entice you to go physically from your familiar space into
that exotic space. In other words, they change the way you behave and
how you allocate your time and money generally. You see the new shoes
on the sports star, you want the new shoes on the sports star. You see
the celebrity in Tahiti, you want to travel yourself to Tahiti. You see
the happy sit-com couples living happy, fulﬁlled lives without children,
you want to live a happy, fulﬁlled life without children.
There would seem to be no doubt that exposure to modern media
is one of the forces driving down fertility in developing countries (and
in developed countries, we should add). The question is whether it
drove down fertility in nineteenth-century Europe, that is, during the
period of transition from premodern stagnation to modern growth. It
almost certainly did. The most obvious evidence of this fact is simple
correlation: fertility declined where mass literacy arose and spread, that
is, in Northwestern Europe and its offshoots.32 Again, correlation is not
causation; we need a mechanism. And we have one, the same that we see
operating in the semi- and undeveloped worlds today: the media were

268

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

making increasing demands on would-be parents’ time and money.
Some of these costs were direct, for example, time and money spent
reading the newspaper. But far more important were the indirect costs,
that is, those associated with the results of being presented with new
possibilities for novelty and, by means of its consumption, personal
gratiﬁcation. Interestingly, Charles Darwin, who had read his share of
newspapers and books, had both on his mind when he drew up a list
of the pros and cons of getting married and having children in 1837
or 1838.33 A family meant “less money for books etc,” as well as less
time to read them (“cannot read in the evenings”). Worse yet, a family
meant he would not be free to go where he liked and associate with
whom he wished. Darwin knew about the world. He’d read about it.
He wanted to see it. If he “married tomorrow . . . ”
. . . there would be an inﬁnity of trouble and expense in getting and furnishing
a house, – ﬁghting about no Society – morning calls – awkwardness – loss
of time every day – (without one’s wife was an angel and made one keep
industrious) – Then how should I manage all my business if I were obliged to
go every day walking with my wife. – Eheu!! I never should know French, –
or see the Continent, – or go to America, or go up in a Balloon, or take
solitary trip in Wales – poor slave, you will be worse than a negro – And then
horrid poverty.

Because Darwin was rich, he could have it all: he ended up marrying, having a large family, and seeing a good portion of the world.
Those in the middle and lower classes, however, were not so fortunate.
The media – print in this case – had shown them a world of possibilities much greater than anyone had ever seen in all human history.
It was in newspapers, chap books, adventure stories, romance novels,
pornography, picture books, and a quickly expanding universe of items
designed precisely to take their time and money – advertisements. The
media showed them that there was something else, something more,
something better. They began to seek it outside the family. We still
do, and to a degree that the Victorians could scarcely comprehend.
According to the United Nations, fertility is less than the replacement
rate in seventy-three countries, which together account for 43 percent
of the world’s population.34 The newspaper-reading Victorians chose
to have fewer children; we Internet-surﬁng moderns are choosing to

have no children. If present trends continue, the Web will have to surf
itself.

media and spiritual well-being
Have the media made us feel spiritually any better? The answer is “no.”
We know this, as we’ll see, because (a) we know that our spiritual wellbeing arises when we believe we are “doing the right thing” in relation to
some transcendental something; (b) we know that the media encourage
us to do the wrong thing, and that modern media encourage us to do
the wrong thing more often.
Like sensory well-being, spiritual well-being is difﬁcult to assess. The
basic problem is that it’s not at all clear what “spiritual well-being” is
or, whatever it may be, whether it can be measured.35 Religious people
typically say that spirituality has something to do with proximity to
the divine. Faiths, however, vary tremendously, as do their notions
of divinity. Others, and especially people who are “spiritual” and not
“religious,” would probably say spirituality has something to do with
serenity, peace of mind, or enlightenment. These notions, too, come
in various ﬂavors, none of which tastes quite like any other. And still
other people, especially hard-core atheists, just dismiss the notion as
metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. After all, there seems to be something
about the very deﬁnition of spirituality that puts it beyond the realm of
the senses and therefore beyond the realm of what can be known.
As Locke might have said, spirituality seems to fall squarely into the
troublesome category of “something, I know not what.”36 All, however,
is not lost, for the traditional believer, the new-age spiritualist, and the
tough-minded atheist can certainly agree on the following. First, that
many people believe they have spirits. Whether they come from beyond
(as the believer would say), are born of spiritual practice (as the spiritualists would say), or are inventions (as the atheists would say) is
irrelevant. They say they have them, and that is enough to establish
the existence of something, if only the claim that they have them. Second, whatever the origin of the claim, most people report the presence
of a spirit as a state of mind. As such, it’s subjective and can’t really
be shared. The only way you can make it known is by word (“I’m
in good spirits”) or deed (“Let me do that for you”). Neither can it be
described using the vocabulary of physical sensation. A state of spiritual
270

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

well-being is not bodily pleasure, nor is a state of spiritual sickness bodily pain. Rather, the one and the other are qualities of mind. Someone
in good spirits will be clear, calm, and conﬁdent; someone in poor spirits will be confused, agitated, and fearful. Finally, most people explain
that the spiritual state is the result of their relationship with something
greater than themselves that lies beyond their comprehension. This mysterious higher power might be god, the natural world, or even society.
If they “go against” it, they say, then they will be in bad spirits; if they
“go with it,” they say, then they will be in good spirits. Again, whether
their explanation is valid is beside the point: all that matters is that this
is what they believe to be the case.
To boil down all we’ve said, spiritual well-being is a mental quality
that often results when people believe they are “doing the right thing”
in relation to some transcendental something. Now to our question:
have the media contributed to our spiritual well-being? Probably not.
First of all, the media have indirectly contributed to our disenchantment by helping to spur economic growth, which in turn directly
allowed us to ignore spiritual questions. For almost all of human history, uncertainty and spirituality walked hand in hand. In premodern
times, death was always near. Moreover, one never knew in what guise
it would come or when it would arrive. It’s no wonder, then, that premodern people paid a lot of attention to life’s big questions: Why am
I here? How should I live? What is the purpose of life? Why must I
die? Neither is it any wonder that, ﬁnding no answers in this world,
they sought them in another, unseen world. Nietzsche famously wrote,
“If we have our own why of life, we shall get along with almost any
how.”37 The unseen world gave premodern people the “why of life”
and thereby enabled them to suffer their difﬁcult “how of life.” Thanks
in part to the media and the economic explosion they facilitated, we
live in material circumstances that no longer require constant – or even
any – attention to spiritual affairs.38 Our “how of life” is not one of
suffering and a probable early grave, but rather of plenty and a probable long life. A child born in a developed country today has a very good
chance of never experiencing want and of living beyond 70 years. We
can put off the big “whys of life” for decades while we pursue lesser
questions like whether we will get into the right college, get the right
job, marry the right partner, live in the right city, have the right number
of children, and pick the right place to retire. The media – that is, other
271

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

people – will answer all these questions. As the end of life approaches,
however, we will begin to ask questions that the media cannot answer.
Even Google cannot tell you whether you have done the right thing in
relation to your higher power. And since you’ve not paid any attention
to the question for the last 70 years – years in which you doggedly pursued worldly things – you probably won’t be able to answer it, either.
You may die with considerable peace of mind, but probably as a result
of some drug a doctor has given you.
Second, the media have directly contributed to our disenchantment
by encouraging us to think in the wrong way. Plato knew why: uniquely
among human tools, the media enable us to create synthetic worlds
where the rules of men and gods somehow do not apply. The media
truck in representations, and we say that representations are not realities. This being so, we believe we can do anything we like in our synthetic
worlds without real penalty. Comforting though this notion might be,
it really isn’t true. There is a difference between representations and
realities, but it does not follow that representations are harmless to
those who consume them. In fact, they can be quite spiritually damaging. To achieve spiritual well-being, you need to do the right thing. But
that is not enough. Years of psychological research have shown that
you also need to think the right thoughts.39 In order to do that, you
need to closely monitor what goes in your mind because it will have a
direct effect on what comes out in terms of your spirit. But we don’t
monitor what goes in at all. There was a time – actually a very long
time – in which elites agreed that representations needed to be regulated.
It’s true that the authorities generally didn’t censor representations in
order to protect the spiritual well-being of the population (ecclesiastical
ofﬁcials being the exception), but they believed that some censorship
was necessary nonetheless. As we’ve seen, they were ﬁghting a losing
battle against ever more powerful media and a seemingly unstoppable
desire for enhanced sensory well-being. At some time in the nineteenth
century, humanity chose sensuality over spirituality, and we are all living with the consequences. Disturbing images may not make you do
disturbing things, but they will deﬁnitely make you think disturbing
thoughts.40 And the thing about disturbing thoughts is that they are,
well, disturbing.
Finally, the media have contributed to our disenchantment by
encouraging us to act in the wrong way. For millennia, social critics
272

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

have been asking whether representations of bad things make people
do bad things. Plato thought they did; modern researchers generally
don’t. But in fact it depends on what we understand by “bad things.”
Exposure to pornography does not seem to make men more likely
to commit rape.41 But exposure to pornography does seem to make
men more likely to masturbate, and indeed masturbate compulsively.42
Now, you may not think that masturbation is a “bad thing.” Many people, however, do, and those among them who masturbate compulsively
while looking at Internet porn are likely suffering spiritually. They are
not, after all, “doing the right thing” in relation to their higher power.
This sort of media-inspired self-harm is actually quite common. You
know you are supposed to treat people kindly, yet you abuse others
in chat rooms. You know you are supposed to study, but you watch
TV instead. You know your work computer is for work, but use it to
surf the web. In each of these cases, the media have led you to do the
wrong thing in real life. Media-driven spiritual harm, however, does
not end with the media consumer. Whether you believe porno-fueled
masturbation is a “bad thing” or not, you probably think that having an active sexual bond with your spouse is a “good thing.” The
trouble is that the one affects the other: the more you masturbate to
Internet porn, the less often you are likely to make love to your wife.43
The former, while not a “bad thing” in and of itself, causes you to
do an acknowledged “bad thing,” thereby causing you spiritual harm.
This sort of media knock-on effect is also quite common. Watching the
reality show Jack Ass is not a “bad thing” until it causes you to hurt
someone while acting like a jackass. Sending text messages while driving is not a “bad thing” until it causes you to injure someone in a car
accident. Listening to Whitney Houston sing “I Will Always Love You”
100 times in a row is not a “bad thing” until it drives your neighbors
insane.

Marx believed the future would bring an era of incredible material
abundance. Using advanced new tools, people would almost effortlessly produce the stuff they needed to live comfortable lives. It would
be a new world of things. He was not wrong. Using advanced new
tools, some people – namely those of us in the developed world – do
almost effortlessly produce all the necessities of existence. We need not
273

A HISTORY OF COMMUNICATIONS

work very hard to acquire all the food, clothing, shelter, and sundry
accessories we could ever reasonably desire.
We do live in a new world of things. Marx, however, did not predict that we would also live in a new world of signs. For the ﬁrst
170,000-odd years of our history, persistent signs were very few. The
reason is shockingly simple: we talked; we did not record. Our total
prehistoric output of persistent signs – carvings, statuary, ornaments,
cave painting, tokens, etc. – would likely have ﬁt into a moderately
sized museum. Once we began to use artiﬁcial media, our output and
stock grew. In Marx’s day, the store of accumulated signs was large. It
doesn’t strain credulity to guess that by the mid-nineteenth century it
comprised billions (109 ) and perhaps trillions (1012 ) of signs recorded in
all manner of media. They were, however, scattered around the world
and unevenly distributed, so the average person had access to only the
tiniest fraction of them. Marx was not an average person: he had access
to the British Museum, which actually held a fair portion of them. It
no longer does, for in our era the output and stock of persistent signs
have both exploded. According to an estimate made in 2000, the world
records between one and two exabytes of unique information on paper,
ﬁlm, optical, and magnetic media each year.44 An exabyte is 1018 bytes,
that is, a million million bytes. In other words, we produce more persistent signs every year than all the people who had ever lived produced
between 180,000 BC and Marx’s era. Moreover, we have much greater
access to our sign stock than Marx did to his. He had to go to the British
Museum to do his research; today the British Museum – and just about
everything else – comes to us. The average person, if he or she has
Internet access, can get a pretty good chunk of all the information ever
recorded, a number much larger than 1018 bytes.
Marx foresaw none of this. Neither did he envision the way in which
signs would come to dominate our lives. Marx’s new world of things
was about making and consuming; our new world of signs is about
encoding and decoding. Marx thought people would realize themselves
through unalienated labor and the unalienated product thereof. It’s true
that people often ﬁnd meaning in their work, and that they enjoy the
stuff they and others make. But work is just work, and stuff is just
stuff – your appetite for both is limited. It turns out that when peoples’
desires for meaningful work and ﬁne stuff are sated, they quickly turn to
encoding and decoding signs. Marx would be astonished at the amount
274

CONCLUSION: THE MEDIA AND HUMAN WELL-BEING

of time we spend engaged in these activities. We wake up to the radio,
read the paper over breakfast, listen to music on the commute to work,
check our email once in the ofﬁce, check our phone messages and make
some calls, surf the web throughout the day for business and pleasure,
listen to the news on the way home, put on some music while we make
dinner, watch TV afterward, and wind up the day, perhaps, by reading
a book as we fall asleep.
The purpose of human life, Aristotle said, was to be well. It seems
hard to disagree with him. We have every right, then, to ask if the
new world of signs, the world in which we live, makes us well or not.
The answer we have given is mixed. The media, and particularly the
modern media, contributed mightily to our material well-being. They
were among the tools that produced the new world of things. The media,
and particularly the modern media, improved our sensory well-being.
They enabled us to break free from our own senses and experience
an astounding variety of things through the senses of others. Finally,
the media, and particularly the modern media, have had a rather less
positive impact on our spiritual well-being. They have made us turn
away from spiritual matters, and have prompted us to compulsively
think and do things that plainly injure our spirits. In this regard, the
new world of signs has taken control of us. As Marx might have said,
we serve the signs rather than the signs serving us. Whether we will ever
realize this is the case and, if so, do anything to liberate ourselves, only
prophets can say.

17. The evidence regarding book ownership is largely based on wills, thus the
obvious trend – increased book ownership – may simply be a reﬂection of an
increase in the number of surviving wills. For an attempt to collect all the data,
see Susan H. Cavanaugh, “A Study of Books Privately Owned in England,
1300–1450,” 2 vols. (Unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania,

18. Consensus is now emerging among scholars of education that the number of
lay schools was increasing rapidly before the Renaissance and Reformation
(contra the views of Lawrence Stone and Joan Simon). On the expansion of
the number of schools (especially elementary and grammar schools) in particular English regions in the ﬁfteenth century, see Nicholas Orme, Education
in the West of England, 1066–1548 (Exeter: University of Exeter, 1976); and

24. The connection between increases in literacy – and acknowledged fact – and
the inﬂuence of Protestantism on it is subject to some dispute. But there is no
doubt regarding Luther’s opinion on literacy: he believed people should be
able to read and understand the scripture or texts based on it. See Richard
Gawthrop and Gerald Strauss, “Protestantism and Literacy in Early Modern Germany,” Past and Present 104 (1984), 31–55; and Ruth Bottigheimer,

the Soviet Constitution of 1937 guaranteed freedom of speech and the press,

33. The literature on the Industrial Revolution is very large, but modern debate
is roughly divisible into two views. The traditional Europe-centered view
is represented by David Landes, The Unbound Prometheus: Technological
Change and Industrial Development from 1750 to the Present (London:
Cambridge UP, 1969). The new world-historical view is represented by Peter
N. Stearns, The Industrial Revolution in World History (Boulder: Westview
Press, 2007). On the challenge of the one by the other, see Jack A. Goldstone,

notions such as “freedom of religion,” “freedom of the press,” “freedom of

on each of these ideas is sizable. For a recent summary of the liberal tradition, see Pierre Manent, An Intellectual History of Liberalism, translated by

was permissible to write and read, say and hear, and show and watch in the

57. In most of Europe television is state-owned, which is to say completely subsidized by tax-payers. But even in the United States, the government subsidizes
both radio and television production (via the Corporation for Public Broadcasting) and radio and television consumption. For example, the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration is subsidizing the purchase of digital-to-analog converters for those 17 million Americans who
do not have digital-ready televisions. See Glenn Derene, “Digital Transition
Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?” Popular Mechanics (May
5, 2008).
58. In neither the United States nor the United Kingdom is television reception
viewed as a legal “right.” If someone builds a code-compliant structure that
blocks your reception, you have no legal recourse. For the United States, see
T. K. McQueen, “Nuisance – No Right to Interference-Free Television Reception,” DePaul Law Review 22 (1972–1973), 870ff. For the United Kingdom,
see Janet O’ Sullivan, “A Poor Reception for Television Nuisance,” Cambridge Law Journal 55:2 (1996), 184–187; and Janet O’ Sullivan, “Nuisance
in the House of Lords: Normal Service Resumed,” Cambridge Law Journal
56:3 (1997), 483–485. That said, both governments have recognized that
they need to take measures to ensure that all citizens have access to radio
and television. More than that, for decades now legal scholars and the courts
have been ﬂirting with a positive “right to access” interpretation of the First
Amendment. See Barron’s seminal “Access to the Press – A New First Amendment Right” and his more recent reviews, “Rights of Access and Reply to
the Media in the United States Today,” Communications and the Law 25:1
(2003), 1–13, and “Access Reconsidered,” George Washington Law Review
76:4 (2008), 826–844.

20. This is the basic argument of Kremer, “Population Growth and Technological
Change,” 681–716.
21. On network externalities (also known as “network effects”), see, among
many others, Michael Katz and Carl Shapiro, “Network Externalities, Competition, and Compatibility,” American Economic Review 75:3 (1985), 424–
440. On knowledge spillover effects, see, among many others, Zvi Griliches,
“The Search for R&D Spillovers,” Scandinavian Journal of Economics 94
(1992), S29–47.
22. The phenomenon of decreasing returns to stimulus was ﬁrst theorized by
Wilhelm Wundt in 1874. See his Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie
(Leipzig: Engelmann, 1874). After his research was rediscovered (notably by
David E. Berlyne in the 1950s), scholars began to study the dynamics of
“interest,” “curiosity,” “sensation seeking,” and their relation to satisfaction.
For an overview, see Paul J. Silvia, Exploring the Psychology of Interest
(Oxford: Oxford UP, 2006).
23. For what follows, see the discussion in Luigino Bruni and Pier Luigi Porta, ed.,
Handbook on the Economics of Happiness (Northampton: Edward Elgar,
2007), 130–134.

Seeking between Combined and Separated Choices,” Journal of Experimental
Psychology: Applied 1 (1995), 34–49.
