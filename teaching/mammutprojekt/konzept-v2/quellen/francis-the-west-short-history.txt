    Introduction  
    We all understand what is meant by ‘the West’ as a cultural concept, even if we cannot define what it means in precise terms. We may also find that we struggle to articulate the impact of the West on the rest of the world. Do we take a balanced view and weigh up the scientific and technological progress it produced against the excesses of colonialism. Or, do we take the view that the West does not merit inclusion in the list of world civilisations?  
    The aim of this book is to trace the origin of ‘the West’ as the modern cultural concept that is loosely recognised today. Even if the term ‘civilisation’ has fallen from favour today I believe it is important to define what we mean by Western values, trace the story of how the west established those values and to set out the positive as well as the negative impacts the west has had on the world.   
    I do this not because I have any truck with identity politics, nationalism, cultural supremacism or any other abhorrent form of politics. Instead I believe it is important that we understand, preserve and cherish Western values. It was the West after all that gave the world the industrial, technological and digital revolutions, modern secular Government, modern farming techniques and modern medicine. The result of these developments has meant that billions of people across the world survived child birth, were immunised against deadly diseases, do not go hungry, are free from nepotism and state corruption, use that technology that makes their lives easier and earn enough money to give their families a decent standard of living.  
    Despite these achievements the story of the West is barely taught as a coherent narrative. The values of the West are under threat today from both inside and out on a scale that has not been seen since the end of the second world war. If we do not teach our children about the story of the West then they are unlikely to stand up to defend its values; they may even fall under the spell of homegrown populists are foreign extremists who are determined to roll back liberal values at home and end the western-led rules based global order abroad. This book is intended to serve as a history of the west as a civilisation and also as a rallying cry to fight for the preservation of western values that have surely done more than any other system to change the world for the better.  
    From our first days at school, we are taught about the accomplishments of ancient civilisations: the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans. The achievements of these empires are known to those who have had only the barest acquaintance with world history. Egyptian pyramids, Greek philosophers, and Roman engineering are rightly considered to be treasures of humanity. Yet for the ordinary inhabitant of these civilisations their lot was often illiteracy, hardship, agrarian toil, and relative poverty.  
    From the beginning of recorded history through to the industrial revolution the material standard of living for ordinary people barely changed, civilisations traded with each other on a limited basis, often via intermediaries and most cultures remained self-contained.   
    Then, around the year 1500AD, the West began to diverge from the rest of the world. By 1900 Western societies thought differently, acted differently, and lived differently from much of the rest of the world.   
    Western technological superiority allowed it to control almost the entire  globe, either directly or indirectly; the first time a civilisation had achieved a global reach. But Western influence was not limited to colonisation; the West has greatly influenced world culture and society and began the age of hyper globalisation that is still evolving today.  
    The divergence that started become apparent in around 1500 can be traced to a series of developments that occurred in an area of Europe roughly bordered by the River Oder and the world of Orthodox Christianity in the east and the Mediterranean Sea and the Ottoman Empire in the south. The late medieval kingdoms, dukedoms and principalities that occupied the European peninsula shared a common religious, intellectual and commercial cultures. It was these medieval kingdoms that developed into a collection of nation states sharing certain cultural features which became recognised as representing Western culture.  
    Whilst it is true, as critics of the West often point out, that there is no agreed formal definition of Western civilisation, Western countries are clearly identifiable in their shared values and features. Broadly, these are democratic and relatively secular government, an independent judiciary and an established rule of law, pluralist societies balanced, the provision of essential services by the state, a free market economy, a rich and diverse artistic and popular culture, and strong scientific traditions.  
    The set of values underpinning Western civilisation have slowly evolved since 1500 and have been debated, argued and fought for: sometimes by lone voices, sometimes by tens of millions of nameless citizens. Once established these values are what has allowed the West to  create a culture that has given the world the computer, the telephone, the television, the radio, the train, the plane, the automobile, pop music, space exploration, mechanical engines, the electric light bulb, democratic government, universal human rights; unequivocally these are inventions and developments that have transformed the way the entire world lives for the better.  
    Equally the West has been responsible for some of the worst crimes of humanity, from the Atlantic slave trade, through to imperialism, two world wars and the holocaust. Westerners should not ignore these crimes but neither should they be a reason for self-flagellation. The moral choices raised by these issues, catalysed European liberals to argue against them and fight for a world in which human liberty and the right to personal happiness underpin the nation state.   
    Western liberals have often shied away from celebrating a concept of Western civilisation for fear of being seen to whitewash history or provide a narrative that encourages racism and nationalist supremacist view of history. But such cultural relativism risks creating a culture in the West were its citizens are unaware of how we got to where we are today. Without a clear understanding of the history of the West we risk failing to appreciate the values that are ancestors fought for and which have allowed the world to develop from agrarian feudalism to a world in which most people have access to electricity, running water, medicine, consumer goods and basic human rights.  
    The West today faces challenges from authoritarian regimes in Russia and China, from Islamic fundamentalism at home and abroad and from home-grown populist nationalists. In the last 500 years the West has, on the balance, created a globalised, more liberal and more prosperous world. It is not the case that this outcome was inevitable; history does not run along a pre-ordained path. If the West had not diverged  from other world civilisations in 1500 there is no evidence to suggest that the rest of the world was on a trajectory towards creating democratic, liberal, modern industrial societies in its place.  
    Without a strong sense of its own history and identity, the West could witness the next 500 years of history being written by retrograde, authoritarian and illiberal forces. That is why the history of the West is important to us all, whoever we are and wherever we live.  
       
    Origins: Medieval Europe  
    Western Civilisation can trace its origins not to the achievements of the Roman Empire, but to its dramatic collapse in the face of Barbarian invasions during the fifth century AD. The fall of the Roman Empire signalled the end of a single Mediterranean culture which had stretched from the Euphrates to the Atlantic for over a thousand years.  
    As Barbarian tribes overran the Western provinces in the fifth century the Roman Empire split into Eastern and Western factions. By 700AD the former Roman provinces in Arabia and North Africa had been overrun by a new and dynamically expansive Islamic Empire. The Eastern provinces survived as the Western Empire dissolved into a patchwork of pagan kingdoms. The reality of a single Roman culture centred around the Mediterranean had disappeared. Three geographic regions, previously united by Rome had splintered and where now destined to evolve as three very distinct cultures over the next 1,000 years until Europe’s development path began to diverge from the rest of the world.   
    As Roman rules, customs, towns and knowledge were abandoned or forgotten, the Empire’s most important surviving legacy, the Catholic Church, began a long and campaign to convert the new pagan inhabitants of Western Europe. Over the coming centuries the emerging patchwork of pagan kingdoms was slowly converted to Christianity by emissaries sent by the Church from its base in Northern Italy.   
       
    The former Roman provinces of the West were eventually replaced by a collection of Christian kingdoms, dukedoms and principalities. They were ruled by aristocracies who lived off the meagre surpluses eked out of the land by the peasant classes. For the next 1,000 years living standards would remain largely static. The contemporary Chinese and Islamic civilisations were marginally the most advanced in the world, but everywhere the vast majority of people lived in absolute poverty with pitifully short life expectancies and a familiarity with physical hardship, bouts of hunger, illness and mortality. This had been the lot of ordinary people across the world since the start of recorded history and would largely remain so it until the Industrial Revolution was well underway.  
       
    A few of Europe’s early medieval Christian kings, such as the Frankish ruler Charlemagne (742-814), tried to resurrect the idea of a pan-European Christian empire. Charlemagne’s realm drew on Germanic, Roman and Christian traditions and succeeded in uniting parts of France, Germany and Italy for the period that he was alive to rule it. But this concept was only as strong as one man’s ambition and fell apart when the empire was divided between his sons. Europe had still to absorb the tremendous impact of pagan Viking raiders from beyond the Northern seas before a relatively settled and largely Christianised continent emerged with the dawn of a new millennium.  
       
    During the European medieval period, which lasted from roughly the year 1000 to the late 1400s, the Church served as the one institution which bound the kingdoms of Western Europe to together. The medieval Catholic Church grew into an immensely powerful and dogmatic organisation: it was a major landowner across Europe and medieval Popes held significant influence over secular monarchs. Questioning of Church doctrine was not tolerated and numerous heretical sects were brutally suppressed during the medieval period inline with Catholic doctrine on heresy.  
       
    Yet between the fall of the Roman Empire and the first stirrings of the Renaissance, the Church was the holder of all Europe’s scholarly knowledge. Monasticism, the concept of withdrawing to study and contemplate the word of God, began in the deserts of Egypt and spread across Europe as the same time that the Roman Empire was collapsing. From the Atlantic islands of Ireland to the mountains of Italy, monasteries retained the literature, art and knowledge of the ancient world.  
       
    In the early medieval period all knowledge and learning was confined within the walls of these monasteries. Literacy was almost exclusive to members of the monastic orders. In the absence of printing presses it was stored in books which could only be copied by a laborious and fantastically expensive process. The scholarship of monasticism was not aimed at understanding the world for the good of mankind but as part of the search for greater religious truth. Away from the monasteries, cathedral schools and secular places of learning managed to cling onto a tradition of inquiry and education which was more open to the wider world and the lives of its inhabitants.  
       
    Over the course of the 12th and 13th centuries the cathedral schools maintained by the Church, developed into a continent-wide network of universities. In most cases the universities were effectively private enterprises, which responded to the demand for a more wide-ranging education than that offered by the monasteries. Establishing autonomy from ecclesiastical authorities was a long and difficult struggle but the autonomy was formally granted in Pope Gregory IX’s (1145-1241) ’Mother of Sciences’ Papal Bull of 1231. This autonomy, granted initially to the University of Paris, would be a crucial step in the development of secular, critical thought which would eventually be applied in Europe.  
       
    As medieval European wealth and trade continued to increase slowly but incrementally, prosperous and increasingly populated states came to require more and more bureaucrats with secular educations. By the 14th century the rulers and nobles of central and northern Europe sponsored a new wave of more secular universities where mathematics, law, philosophy and logic were taught to create a new generation of highly educated lawyers, administrators and bureaucrats.  
       
    At the same time significant advances in science were being made in the Islamic world. In particular Abū ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (780-850) was instrumental in introducing Arabic numerals, alchemy, the decimal point and algebra (derived from the Arabic al-jabr) to Western Europe. In 1085 Spanish reconquistadors had recaptured the city of Toledo from the Moors and in its great libraries were discovered works of Socrates and Aristotle, which were completely unknown to Europe at this time.  
       
    As well as works by the pre-Christian Ancient Greeks, theories by contemporary non-Christian such as those by Abu Ma’shar (787- 886) these works debated the nature and origins of the world without reference to Christianity and based on nature and reason alone. This stream of learning which existed outside the narrative of the Old Testament threatened to overturn the Church’s view of the world and was in grave danger of being forbidden by the papal authorities  until there emerged a brilliant theologian who could marry (for a few hundred years at least) divine revelation with secular philosophy.   
       
    Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was a Domincan monk who completed his education at university in Paris, where he was introduced to the works of Aristotle. Aquinas believed that human reason was a gift from God and, as long as it was used correctly, it did not come into contradiction with divine revelation. Aquinas gathered his thoughts in a vast work, the Summa Theologica which was left unfinished upon his death, but his ideas lived on in the movement known as scholasticism which incorporated the study of secular philosophy into Christian theology. Scholasticism encouraged Christians to use their God-given reason and intellect to learn about his Creation; in theory no question was too difficult or too obscure for a Christian theologian.  
       
    By the eve of the Renaissance, Europe had a built a network of nominally secular universities. These institutions had the freedom to embark on the pursuit of knowledge using the scientific method, wherever it may lead. It was this network of secular centres for learning which would help ensure that Western European scientific knowledge began to pull away from that of the Arab and Chinese worlds.   
       
    During the 12th and 13th century, there were also significant if not revolutionary changes in the development of new technologies. The development of the windmill in the  12th century brought some much needed technological improvements to European agriculture. At some point in the 13th century the first clocks to use mechanical escapement mechanisms were developed; allowing Europeans to measure the abstract notion of time on a widespread basis. This was followed by the introduction of spectacles around the year 1300 and accompanied by the gradually increasing improvements in the seaworthiness of ships. Scholars such as Roger Bacon (1220-1292) Jean Buridan (1295-1363), William of Occam (1285-1347), Thomas Bradwardine (1290-1349) and Nicole Oresme  (1320-1382) were also developing their own mathematical and proto-scientific insights which laid the fundation for modern European science  
       
    Despite their shared Christian heritage, European kingdoms were regularly torn apart by dynastic quarrels and foreign invasions as they would be through to the 20th century. Few Kings could rule as a tyrant and be sure of staying in power without delegating regional power to his barons and the newly wealthy merchant classes. Medieval Kings alienated these powerful interests at their own peril.   
       
    In the 12th century England’s King John (1166-1216) pushed his nobles to the point of revolt by his tyrannical behaviour and military incompetence. On 17 May 1215 a group of rebel barons seized control of London and accused the king acting above the law by seizing land and killing his subjects at will. They demanded a written contract with the king making him answerable to national law; a contract which would enshrine the rights of every subject no matter how lowly born. The result was Magna Carta a key early record of the philosophy developing in parts of Western Europe. Although the practical effect of Magna Carta is debatable, it sets out many of the principles of civil liberties that are considered sacred today:  
       
    “NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right”  
       
    Magna Carta may have been peculiar to England, but even the most autocratic kings of Western Europe had to establish special assemblies to seek advice from nobles on the most important issues of the day; namely tax and warfare. Such assemblies were the ancient forerunners of Europe’s modern parliamentary systems (parliament deriving from parley: the French verb meaning ‘to talk’). As these assemblies were invariably dominated by the need to gather new taxes to pay for costly foreign wars, the newly wealthy merchant classes needed to be consulted and brought into the system.   
       
    Those without power or wealth remained excluded from consultation. For much of the medieval period Europe was dominated by the feudal system in which peasants were the property of their lords with no more rights than the animals who shared their hovels; indeed laws even allowed lords and barons to sell their serfs like cattle. In the mid-14th century one third of the population of England remained in bondage, tied to the land of their lords. It would take an act of God to shatter a system which had been rigidly enforced for centuries  
       
    In October 1347 a group of Genoese traders fled back to their home port to escape a siege of the trading city of Caffa in the Crimea by invading Mongols. Like most ships, their galleys were infested with rats, unwittingly the traders had introduced the bubonic plague to mainland Europe. By 1349 it had devastated almost the entire continent from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia. It is estimated that between 1347 and 1349 60% of the population of Western Europe died from bubonic plague.  
       
    The ‘Black Death’, as the plague became known, was a human tragedy on a continental scale,. It also led to a fundamental shift in the balance of power between the landed aristocracy and the landless, labouring poor. In the aftermath of the plague, entire villages were abandoned, fields went untilled and labour became a scarce resource. Natural market forces allowed labourers to claim increased wages and better conditions. Crucially they could offer their services to competing lords for a higher price and more freedom.  
       
    The aristocracy reacted with a sense of panic to the newfound power of the peasant classes. In England laws were passed to limit the wages of labourers to the level they had been before the Black Death. Laws even stipulated the quality of cloth a peasant could wear in a desperate attempt to enforce the old system. When Richard II (1367-1400) of England tried to implement a deeply unfair poll tax in 1381, peasants rose in direct revolt against the aristocracy. After executing the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Treasurer of England and burning hundreds of documents relating to their bondage, the peasants issued a list of extraordinary demands directly to the King: an end to serfdom, no lords apart from the king, all property to be held in commonwealth.   
       
    Ultimately their revolutionary demands were too much for the ruling classes to contemplate: the rebels were defeated and their leaders brutally executed. Yet the idea that a man’s status was determined at birth and fixed until death, the fundamental principal of inequality underpinning medieval society, had been challenged and broken. Never again could the ruling elite enforce the system of feudalism. Once unleashed the forces of social change had rolled back feudalism until it had all but disappeared from Northern Europe by the end of the 15th century.  
       
    Medieval Europe remained a place where hunger and want dominated the lives of the masses, and where superstition and intolerance dominated society. Belief in sorcery and witchcraft was endemic and men and women could be publicly flogged for perceived sexual transgressions or other acts found to be contrary to God’s law. Knowledge of the world outside Europe was still largely based on myth and hearsay; even the most learned scholars were quite sure that the lands of Asia were populated by men with the heads of dogs and humans whose faces were in their chests.   
       
    Despite the growth of towns in the late Middle Ages, 90% of Europeans lived in the countryside, invariably entailing a life of hard toil and high mortality. Aside from wind and water the only sources of power remained that of man and beast. Medical knowledge had improved as a result of the dissemination of Arab and Ancient Greek theories but was still relatively primitive and based on inaccurate beliefs. Average life expectancy was just 30 in even the wealthiest European states; a mere 20 in the less fortunate areas of the continent. Death dominated medieval society: even in relatively wealthy England, a village of one hundred households would witness a funeral on average every 18 days. In the searingly hot summer of 1473 it was recorded that exhausted peasants would regularly drop dead whilst at work in their fields.  
       
    At the same time, the late medieval period also witnessed slow, subtle changes to society. States were becoming increasingly organised, bureaucratic and militarised. The competing barbarian tribes of the early middle ages had coalesced into prototype nation states with embryonic national identities. Literacy was increasing rapidly, scribes could be found in even modest sized late-medieval settlements. The early European states were also armies that no longer relied upon the medieval weapons of longbows and catapults. Gunpowder had first been adopted from the Chinese but late medieval European craftsmen soon developed guns that were significantly more advanced than those wielded by Chinese and Arab armies.   
       
    In the 15th century a merchant class which had grown wealthy on trade, law and business began to hold significant power across Europe. The very wealthiest achieved a level of power to challenge that held by the old aristocracy. A man’s status at birth no longer necessarily determined his status at death. Slavery had largely disappeared. The emancipation of peasants from the dead hand of serfdom created a large and flexible labour pool, ready to participate in changing economies.  
       
    In 1455 Johanness Guttenburg (1398-1468) invented the movable printing press in Mainz and produced the Guttenburg Bible. By this time humanist philosophy had come to dominate intellectual debate in Europe’s network of secular universities. Printing reached Spain, Italy and France by 1470 and England, the Low Countries and Eastern Europe by 1480.   
       
    In the last 50 years of the 15th century, Europe was becoming a powerful centre of science and technology, edging ahead of the Islamic, Indian and Chinese empires. Discoveries and inventions from the East - the compass, the astrolabe, gunpowder and guns - had been adopted enthusiastically and improved upon by European craftsmen. Europeans were also increasingly coming to lead the world of in their mastery of mechanical technology and the accuracy of their mechanical clocks.  
       
    Life was still often brutally short, ordinary people were still desperately poor and disease and hunger plagued entire populations. In such a society, where all chances of survival seemed to depend on divine providence, it is understandable that religion permeated every aspect of life. Indeed it is important to remember that Europeans would describe themselves as belonging to Christendom for centuries before gradually being displaced by the secular notion of ‘Europe’ in the 16th century.  
       
    However, it was no longer unquestioningly accepted that the nature of the world was a divinely held mystery and ultimately beyond human understanding. During the medieval period European intellectuals began to realise that the world could be observed, understood and, increasingly, controlled.   
       
    Renaissance  
       
       
    The term ‘the Renaissance’ was first used by the art historian Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574) and today the era is still associated with the iconic artistic works of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli and their peers. But the Renaissance was not simply an artistic movement. The era covered a period of increasingly sophisticated commerce and trade in the northern Italian city states and the emergence of humanism, a relatively secular philosophy that existed alongside traditional Catholicism.  
       
    After the turbulence of the early post-Roman period, Italian coastal settlements were well placed to exploit the increasing trade between western Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean and ports marking the end of the Silk Road route from China. Tiny fishing villages such as Genoa and Venice thrived as trading ports and joined ancient towns like Milan and Padua to become wealthy and populous trading city states.   
       
    In the first two centuries of the second millennium the wealthiest and powerful families in these cities established regimes known as communes which were aimed at protecting the security, stability, wealth and independence of each city-state. This new aristocracy initially treated each city as its own fiefdom but was eventually forced to share power with the emerging popolo, lose groups of citizens made up of trade guilds and merchants.  
       
    By the time the popolo came to stake their claim on power in the early 1300s Northern Italy was one of the world’s pre-eminent commercial and trading centres. Literacy and education in secular subjects such as law, bookkeeping and arithmetic were perhaps more widespread than anywhere else in the world.  
       
    The volume of trade with other European states and the Orient required increasingly sophisticated methods to keep account of transactions, contracts, exchanges and order. Paper, a Chinese invention, had been manufactured in Italy since the 13th century: double entry bookkeeping and bills of exchange developed over the 14th century (versions of the latter having been in use in Arabia and China for centuries beforehand).   
       
    In Venice Jewish immigrants from the Byzantine Empire were able to establish a sophisticated banking sector to service Christian merchants forbidden from making profit on credit by religious taboo. Florentine bankers pioneered the exchange of currency and other banking services. In 1494 a Franciscan friar named  Luca Pacioli (1445 – 1517) published Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità a work which synthesised the latest mathematical knowledge with a description of what are essentially the basics of modern accountancy.  
       
    These developments had had helped to facilitate the growth of commerce in the late middle ages but above all else trade and business craved credit. In Florence, one of the most successful and powerful of the city states, the ruthless and enterprising Medici Family acting as a small firm of money lenders used cunning financial tricks and loopholes to avoid the taboo on usury.   
       
    From the 15th century the Medici combined ruthless and ambition, meticulous bookkeeping and business acumen to dominate the commercial and political leadership of Florence. The Medici represented the emergence of a merchant class which had been accumulating wealth throughout the High Middle Ages. At the same time as ruthlessly pursuing ever greater power and wealth the Medici, together with Florentine merchants’ guilds acted as patrons for emerging ideas concepts about art and humanism which had sprung from an education system that increasingly concentrated on secular subjects.  
       
    In 1345 Petrach (13014-1374), a poet to the papal courts discovered a bundle of Cicero’s letters in a monastic library in Verona and over his lifetime continued to amass a huge library of works by philosophers and poets, architects and orators, both Greek and Roman. The enthusiasm for things Greek and Roman had never truly disappeared from Europe and by the 15th century the gradual accumulation of ancient texts had created a kind of critical mass. Added to this Italy was flooded by a wave of Greek-speaking Byzantine scholars who fled the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1452.   
       
    Where the approach of Petrach and his followers differed from other medieval scholars is that they were devoted to ‘studia humanitatis’, that is to say humanity: the condition of man and human nature as opposed to theology and the study of matters belonging to God. Humanists stressed the importance of studying ancient secular ideas as well as the bible in order find new solutions and understanding of the field of human experience through a spectrum of different viewpoints. Other late medieval Italian scholars such as Boccaccio (1313-75) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459) amassed huge libraries of works by Roman writers covering ancient ideas on science, engineering, philosophy and architecture. The concept of humanism pioneered by Petrach spread across Italy and by the 1400s was the dominant intellectual and cultural force across Europe, although its spiritual remained the thriving commercial centres of late medieval Northern Italy.  
       
    Humanist education had come to dominate Europe’s expanding network of schools over this period and grammar, rhetoric, Latin, Greek, politics, poetry, history and ethics were the predominant subjects on the curriculum of Renaissance schools. The church’s monopoly on guidance through life was now complemented by classical sensibilities to be found in ancient texts. Once the highest calling for an educated young man from a wealthy family had been a life devoted to prayer and abstinence as a monk in a secluded monastery. In 15th century Italy an appreciation of art and architecture, poetry and literature, philosophy and morality were the mark of the urbane gentleman. The prevailing concentration on abstinence and prayer was beginning to be replaced by an emphasis on wealth and pleasure.  
       
    Although humanism started as a principally philosophical school of thought, humanist ides together with developments in mathematics in 15th century Italy began to influence artists and craftsmen who were looking for new way of representing the world around then. Taking a lead from the influential 13th century painter Giotto, Tuscan artist Piero della Francesca (1415-1492) used his own knowledge of geometry and mathematics to produce paintings which were unprecedented in their use of perspective. Artists were now able to create works which gave the viewer a sense of there being three dimensions.  Under the influence of humanism and their patrons, self-made merchants and artisans who had made the world their own, Florentine artists gravitated towards depicting the world around them  
       
    Between 1402 and 1404 two young Florentine citizens named Filipo Brunelleschi (1377-1446) and Donatello (1386-1466) trained in the cities craftwork industries visited the ruins of ancient Rome. Upon his return to Florence Brunelleschi designed a number of classically inspired buildings before winning the competition held by the Florentine wool merchants’ guild to design a new dome for Florence Cathedral. Brunelleschi’s brilliance was to combine the medieval rib-vaulting architecture with the techniques of dome building inspired by Ancient Rome and the most modern engineering techniques.  
       
    The Medici family led the way in the patronage of the arts in the late 15th century and were instrumental in funding the early careers of Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) and Michelangelo (1475-1564) whose precocious artistic talents led to him being drawn into the Medici court and cultural circle immersed in poetry and philosophy  
       
    Classical sculptors had celebrated the human nude, something which had been effectively banished from medieval art as a result of Catholic associations of nudity with eroticism and sin. Ancient pagan societies had no such conception of sin or shame and Renaissance artists who revered the work of the ancient masters rediscovered the beauty of the human nude for European art. Whilst the Medicis and other patrons of the period commissioned a huge number of religious pieces of art, secular works such as Venus by Botticelli (1445-1510) also began to become widely appreciated in Europe for the first time since the fall of Rome.  
       
    In 1494 the French King Charles VIII (1470-1498) marched over the Alps with an army of 30,000 and swept down the Italian peninsular to lay claim to the Kingdom of Naples. Over the next 50 years Italy became a battleground for the dynastic campaigns of the French, Spanish and Hapsburg monarchies. At the same time Italy’s commercial dominance of Europe went into a rapid as decline as states on the Atlantic seaboard opened up new trade routes with the the Far East. Such upheavals precipitated the decline of the Italian Renaissance and the Catholic Church reclaimed its position as the overwhelming power in Italy.  
       
    The Catholic Church eventually overtook merchant families such as the Medici as the single most important source of patronage in the early 16th century. Indeed perhaps the three greatest Renaissance masterpieces were commissioned by the church. Yet the Last Supper (da Vinci), the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (Michelangelo) and The School of Athens by Raphael (1483-1520) embody the Renaissance ideals of realism and humanity. All three works were completed between 1506 and 1512 and mark the apex of Renaissance artistic achievement. By the mid-16 century the wealth and power of Northern Italian city-states began to wane and the Catholic Church became subsumed with the events of the Reformation with some conservatives calling for the nudes painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel to be covered up.  
       
    But the triumphs of the Renaissance artists were strong enough to survive the turbulence of the 16th century. This was an age in which artists had become heroes, celebrities not only in their home cities, but thanks to printing across the whole of Europe. Michelangelo was widely known as ‘Il Divino’.  
       
    This veneration of art and artists was formalised by Giorgio Vasari whose ground-breaking work of art history ‘The Lives of Great Artists’ traced the emergence of Renaissance from the mere craftsmen to the stage of perfection reached by Michelangelo. Vasari also designed the world’s first art gallery, the Ufizi, in 1560 and helped to found the Florence Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno in 1563. For the educated and wealthy elite at least, art had become as important a part of Western civilisation as commerce and science.  
       
    By the 16th century Europe, both north and south of the Alps was continuing to produce outstanding artists and schools of artistic thought in such numbers that to list all those of note in this century alone would require a separate book. Civilisation may be defined by some as being represented by the Sistine Chapel, others may consider the establishment of democracy or the rule of law as better representing the essence of civilisation. Ultimately western culture encompasses a high regard for art as much as the establishment of democracy of scientific endeavour.  
       
    The Renaissance was important in breaking from the monopoly of religious influence on art as secular patrons began to commission works from the most famous artists.The freedom to represent the human condition through artistic expression is as important today as it was 500 years ago.

    Exploration, Conquest and Trade  
       
    There was never a widespread belief in the idea of a flat earth amongst medieval seafarers: Greek and Roman concepts about a spherical earth had survived through to medieval times. Nevertheless, medieval seafaring was a largely coast hugging affair and the shape of the earth was largely irrelevant to medieval seafarers who rarely left the coastal waters (aside from notable seafaring cultures such as the Vikings).  
       
    Medieval maps did, however, commonly place Jerusalem at the centre of the world and applied lavish detail to the depiction of biblical locations such as the Garden of Eden. No medieval map hinted at the possibility that there might be a vast land mass waiting to be discovered across the Atlantic Ocean. That such a vast continent might exist beyond the Western horizon had not even been hinted at by the Greeks or the Romans or even the Holy Scriptures.  
       
    Prior to the 15th century it may have seemed most likely that the future mastery of the world’s oceans would belong to the Chinese or the Arabs; civilisations which had explored the east coast of Africa and traded with Spice Islands of south-east Asia. Yet the Arabs never rounded the Cape of Good Hope, nor did they show much inclination to do so. The Chinese admiral Zheng He reached east Africa with a huge imperial fleet, but in 1480 the Ming court abandoned any further oceanic expeditions and moved to seal China off from what was considered to be a backward outside world.  
       
    By the end of the 15th century both the Chinese and Arab civilisations had turned in on themselves. Alone then amongst the great civilisations, Europe pursued the exploration of the earth. European seafarers were primarily motivated by commercial gain and there was much more incentive for Europeans to travel to the source of the spice trade and cut out Arab and Chinese middle-men (Arabs and Chinese had little need for the produce of late medieval Europe).  
       
    By 1400, the Genoese and Venetians were had already established maritime empires although largely confined to the Mediterranean. There was also a significant amount of trade across the Baltic and North Sea and the English had long imported wine directly from Bordeaux. European sailors had been using early compasses since the 12th century, perhaps having copied the technology from the Chinese via the Arabs.  
       
    Around 1300, an unknown European invented the ‘dry compass’. Essentially a compass needle in a box which was attached to a pivot fitted to the keel, meaning that the compass automatically gave the direction of the ship even as it changed course. Ptolemy’s ‘Geography’, the 2nd century repository of Greek geographical knowledge was rediscovered in the West in 1397 and added to the impetus of Europeans eager to increase their knowledge of the world.  
       
    By the 15th century Europeans had begun to develop more sophisticated mapping techniques than those possessed by either the Arabs or the Chinese. The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 and the resulting increase in spice prices, spurred further exploration of the Western seaboard of Africa by Portugal with the aim of discovering a long sea route to India.  
       
    The Portuguese pioneered the first great voyages of exploration outside the home waters of the European continent. By combining the Arab lateen sail with the European square-rig and stern-post rudder to improve the seaworthiness of their caravels in the early 1400s, the Portuguese possessed the most sophisticated ships of their day. Later in the 15th century ocean going vessels began to be fitted with five rather than three masts, further improving their ability to undertake long sea voyages.  
       
    Over the course of the 15th century the Portuguese mastered the science of navigating long distance ocean routes, settling Madeira in the 1420s and the Azores in the 1430s. By 1445 the Portuguese had reached Senegal. In 1473 they crossed the equator and in 1483 they rounded the Cape of Good Hope and in 1498 Vasco de Gama (1460-1529) led an expedition that reached India.   
       
    Six years before Vasco de Gama’s expedition, a Genoese sailor named Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) had set sail on a westerly course across the Atlantic, hoping to find a route to the spice islands for the Spanish crown. Columbus never found the westward route, but landed instead on Hispaniola, a tiny island on the huge continent of the Americas. A continent that no-one - other than its indigenous inhabitants - had supposed existed. As explorers followed in Columbus’ wake and the vastness of the continent was realised the new landmass came to be known as the ‘New World’.   
       
    Meanwhile European expeditions continued to traverse the globe, in 1522 an expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan (1480-1521)succeeded in circumnavigating the globe. Such expeditions were made possible by the new maritime technologies employed on European ships but also by increasing knowledge of the structure of the globe. Charts were initially based on Ptolemy’s Geography but improvements and additions were made as increased experience in deep ocean seafaring exposed errors in Ancient Greek theoretical assumptions.   
       
    The first Atlas, a collection of sea charts, was published in the early 16th century and in 1541 Gerhardus Mercatur (1512-94) pioneered the use of curved maps with intersecting lines of longitude and latitude. European fleets spread across the globe rapidly during this time. English fishing fleets began trawling for cod off the coast of Newfoundland; the French, Dutch and English were exploring the North American coast; the Spanish and Portuguese had divided South America between themselves and all five of the major maritime nations were establishing trading networks in India and South East Asia.  
       
    During the 15th century thousands of ships would set sail from the great European seaports bound for the Americas, Africa and Asia, intent on commerce, trade and conquest; not a single Arab or Asian ship made the trip in the opposite direction until three hundred years later. Not only did Europeans possess overwhelmingly superior maritime technology and seamanship, but they fitted their ships with canons which were far superior to anything possessed by their Ottoman and Chinese contemporaries.  
       
    It did not take long for Europeans states to exploit their dominance of the world’s deep water oceans. The Portuguese were the first to began the exploration of the world outside Europe and they were also the first to realise the benefits of trade enforced by the threat of violence. A prototype colonial economy was established on the island of Madeira in the 15th century and the first African slaves to be brought to Europe were sold at a market in Lisbon in 1444. After Vasco de Gama successfully established an easterly route to Asia the Portuguese established fortified trading posts along the coast of East Africa, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and by 1557, China.  
       
    Spain turned its attention away from the east and focussed on the riches the New World promised. The Spanish rapidly conquered the islands of the Caribbean, which were populated by Stone Age tribes, and established colonial economies based on agriculture and the seizure of gold. The indigenous inhabitants of the islands were totally wiped out in the process, partly by the Spanish - who committed systematic massacres, -but also due to the native people’s lack of immunity to European viruses such as the common cold.  
       
    The Spanish settlers who travelled to the New World were often a mix of veteran mercenaries and soldiers and lower middle-class gentry; all of whom saw the New World as their God given opportunity to make personal fortunes. On such man was Hernan Cortes (1485-1547) who in 1519 seized the moment to raise a band of men in Cuba whom he led to the Mexican mainland without obtaining the authority of the Spanish crown.  
       
    Cortes’ expedition soon encountered the Aztec empire which, despite dominating Mexico and possessing great astronomical knowledge, was a deeply traditional and agricultural society. With fewer than 500 men Cortes was able to exploit the political naivety and passivity of the Aztec rulers, and the superiority of European firepower, to defeat and conquer the entire Aztec empire.  
       
    Francisco Pizzaro (1471-1541), was similarly able to conquer the entire Inca Empire with even fewer men and Spain and Portugal soon exercised total control of the southern American continent from Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego.  
       
    From the start the economy of the Spanish Empire was based based on naked exopropriation. A silver mine was established at Potosi, which was to be Europe’s main source of bullion for the next three centuries, at the expense of the tens of thousands of indigenous people who toiled and died there. In common with pre-Enlightenment views, the Spanish took a zero-sum view of economics and believed there was only a finite amount of wealth in the world. As such the crown forbade the development of colonial industries that could rival those of Spain.   
       
    Instead the Spanish developed an encomienda system which depended on the virtual enslavement of indigenous Americans. The Spanish crown had always claimed it was civilising the Americas in the name of God, though its treatment of indigenous Americans betrayed its other motives of greed and avarice. The Catholic Church was complicit with the Crown in the exploitation of the New World but from the start it also lobbied for greater protection of indigenous peoples. Bartolomeo de las Casas (1484-1566), a Spanish settler who became the first priest to by ordained in the New World, dedicated his life to arguing against the abuse of indigenous Americans and advocating an early concept of the universality of human rights.  
       
    However, despite some additional legal protections for non-Europeans, the Spanish colonial system remained exploitative and racist until the Latin American colonies gained their independence in the early 19th century. Despite the huge expropriation of bullion from South America, the Spanish Empire did not establish a sustainable colonial economy and the power of the Portuguese and Spanish states was eclipsed by that of the English, French and Dutch in the 17th century.  
       
    Sugar had been introduced to Europe by Arab traders in the Middle Ages and was planted by the Portuguese and Spanish on their porto-colonies on Madeira and the Canaries. By the early 1700s as the English and French set up huge sugar plantations on their Caribbean possessions, sugar had become an irreplaceable commodity for Europe’s growing middle classes. The growing demand for sugar and the high mortality rates for European settlers in the Caribbean, created the start of a trade in African slaves in the 1600s. The Atlantic slave trade would soon become as addictive for European merchants as sugar was for European consumers.  
       
    Further North the English, French and Dutch established a number of settlements on the Eastern seaboard of North America which after initial difficulties, developed successful agricultural economies exporting tobacco, furs and other commodities to Europe. By 1700 the English had established a collection of colonies stretching from Florida to Newfoundland with a population approaching  one million and an economy that had overtaken the sugar plantations of the Caribbean.  
       
    Squeezed between the declining powers of the Spanish and Portuguese empires and the ascendancy of the French and English, were the commercially advanced Dutch provinces. The Dutch were able to combine maritime technology with commercial wealth and establish a series of colonies in the New World and in the spice producing areas of Asia. Voyages to the East Indies were long, dangerous and unpredictable and it made sense for merchants to pool their resources and spread the risks. By 1600 there were half a dozen or incipient East India companies operating out of Dutch ports. But the companies would only exist for a duration of a voyage before folding once the proceeds of a successful trip had been shared out between the investors.  
       
    However, competition from other Western European states meant the trading posts in the East Indies had to be fortified and defended, something that temporary companies did not have the capacity to do. These strategic concerns prompted the Dutch parliament (the States-General) to coalesce the disparate companies into one body, the Dutch East India Company, or the VOC as it was known by its Dutch acronym. The VOC was granted a monopoly on all Dutch trade between the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of Magellan and its existence was initially fixed for a period of 21 years.   
       
    The company paved the way for a primitive version of capitalism, enabling thousands of people to pool their resources for risky long-term ventures. If the venture failed any liability was limited to the company and not to individual investors, who were only liable for their stake in the company.  
       
    The company was open to investment by all citizens of the United Provinces with no upper limit on the amount to be raised. Shareholders came from all walks of life with 1,143 in Amsterdam alone. The scale of the investment in VOC was unprecedented and the amount raised, 6.45 million Guilders, dwarfed the capital of its English rival the East India Company which boasted a mere £68,373 (820,000 Guilders).  
       
    The VOC was not, at first, a commercially successful company. It spent all its capital fighting rival Spanish and Portuguese fleets for control of the spice islands and in its first dividend payments, not made until 1610, were paid spices due to a lack of cash. The VOC shares had quickly begun to change hands and, in 1612 it was decided that the company would not be liquidated after 21 years as planned, meaning that any investor who needed their money back would have to sell their shares to another investor. Thus the world’s first joint-stock limited company created the world’s first stock market.  
       
    In 1609 the Amsterdam Exchange Bank was founded and VOC shares quickly came to be accepted as collateral for loans ; thereby forging a new sophisticated economy involving limited company, stock exchange and bank. The bank began to develop the system of transfers, cheques and direct debits which are a fundamental part of banking today. The sophistication of the Dutch commercial system and the power of its navy meant that its grip on the South East Asian spice island was secure and the islands that today form Indonesia would remain in Dutch hands until the Second World War.  
       
    The English, fierce rivals of the Dutch throughout the 17th century found the door to the South East Asian spice islands closed to them. The English soon turned their attention to another land of opportunity, ripe for trade backed by cannon and gunboat. The English East India Company was formed a year earlier than its Dutch rival and concentrated on the ancient civilisation of the Indian sub-continent, establishing trading outposts in Mughal India in the early 1600s. Over the course of the century the Company grew rich on the profits of trade between India and England and successfully lobbied Parliament to be granted a monopoly. By 1720 15% of British exports originated from India, (with tea becoming recognised as a national beverage) and the sub-continent had become a cornerstone of the country’s trading network. Britain had not yet established formal colonies in India, but as the Moghal Empire collapsed in the early 1700s, it would only be a matter of time it realised that an entire sub-continent lay open to whichever European power wished to claim it.  
       
       
    Reformation  
       
    Throughout the middle ages the Church was the dominant intellectual, moral and political force in society; it had a greater impact on peoples’ lives than the most powerful Kings. There had always been calls for limited reform of the Church, but organised dissent had was either repressed or driven out. Dissenters such as the French Cathars or the English Lollards had aimed to return to the seemingly purer, more spiritual origins of the early Catholic Church; both uprisings were repressed with great brutality.  
       
    By the start of the 16th century then the Catholic Church had enjoyed a monopoly on Christian theology in Western Europe for over 1,000 years. In that time the Church had grown corrupt and immensely powerful; a power maintained through violence, wealth and dogma.  
       
    But the Church’s grip on power was delivered a shattering blow by a pious young Franciscan monk in a quiet German backwater, hundreds of miles from the centres of European power. In 1517 Martin Luther (1483-1546) nailed his ‘Ninety-Five Thesis’ - disputing elements of Catholic doctrine - to the door of Wittenberg Cathedral.   
       
    The issue that caused Luther to publicly dispute Catholic doctrine was the sale of so-called indulgences. In a practice that evolved through the middle ages, sinners - in medieval Catholic theology it was virtually impossible to avoid committing some kind of sin - could purchase indulgences to save their souls from being trapped in purgatory. There was widespread anxiety common amongst even the most pious individuals that they had not done enough to earn salvation; this anxiety was also manifested in the patronage of many of the great Renaissance works of art dedicated to the glory of God. The system had a certain medieval logic but was ripe for abuse. In 1515 a new round of indulgences were issued which were nakedly designed to pay for Michalengelo’s magnificent new Basilica of St Peter in Rome.  
       
    Luther was appalled by the commercialisation of spirituality and reached the conclusion that the sale of indulgences was merely a symptom of the inherently corrupt theology of the Catholic Church. In the ‘Ninety-Five Thesis’ Luther argued that the forgiveness of sin was God’s alone to grant and the sale of indulgences should be ended.  
       
    It was not until January 1518 that the ‘Ninety-Five Thesis’ were copied into print by friends of Luther but once copies had been printed they had spread across Europe within two months. Luther’s fame grew and in 1519 and his stance against the church hardened, leading to his excommunication in 1520.   
       
    It is important to remember here that Luther was a thoroughly medieval man; religious to an extent that we would now consider fundamentalist, he also scoffed at Copernicus’ notion that the earth orbited the sun. Luther did not want to create the modern world but rather create a society that could return the pure moralism of early Chrstianity. Yet Luther did not live in the early Christian age. Once his manifesto for revolution had been printed and disseminated across Europe, its message was no longer his to control; instead it became subject to the machinations of secular rulers and the grudges of the European peasantry.  
       
    The speed with which Luther’s ideas spread across Germany and Europe is testament to the power of the printing press and its ability to create a continental culture of ideas (printing presses were not widely adopted by the Ottomans until the 19th century). But although Luther used the latest technology to spread his views, his message was one of a return to the simple and pure piety of early Christianity and an attack on the wealth and extravagance of the Catholic clergy. It was a simple message and crucially, Luther was able to provide Germans with hymns, prayers and scriptures written in their own language.  
       
    Luther is only the most famous of a number of figures who drove The Reformation. His Swiss contemporary Huldrych Zwingli (1484-1531) also believed that scripture was the sole basis of religious truth and the intercession of saints and clergy sullied the purity of faith. Encouraged by the stand taken by Luther Zwingli embarked on his own reformation in 1522 and by 1525 his home town of Zurich had witnessed the removal of religious icons from churches and the start of masses in German rather than Latin. Similar events began to occur in towns and villages across Switzerland and the Germanic states, driven by thousands of individuals whose names have been lost to history.   
       
    Luther’s initial theological criticisms became subsumed by a huge peasant rebellion which broke out in across the German princely states in 1524 after decades of simmering hatred at the oppressive rule of nobles and rich Clergy. The revolt of 1524-25 was brutally put down, (like peasant revolts before and after) but over the next decades reforms inspired by Luther’s ideas were gradually implemented across parts of Germany. In the 1529 Diet of Speyer, a summit of the leaders of the German princely states, an edict was issued condemning Luther’s ideas, six princes present at the diet signed an official ‘protestation’ at the edict and ‘Protestants’ thus had a name to attach to their political identity.   
       
    After a number of years of fighting between Germanic princes and their subject states over the adoption of the new faith, the 1555 Peace of Augsburg gave cities the freedom to adopt Protestantism provided individual Catholics retained the right to worship freely. Europe had, through much bloodshed, adopted the principle of religious tolerance and individual freedom, but millions more lives would be lost before this fundamental human right became a sacred concept of Western civilisation.  
       
    In the second half of the 16th century the process of reformation started by Luther had taken on a life of its own and was propelled along by new protagonists such as Jean Calvin (1509-1564) who established a kind of theocratic state in Geneva in which music and dancing in public was banned (a policy not too dissimilar from the Wahabbis in contemporary Saudi Arabia). Calvin’s ideas spilled over into his native France where a growing number of Protestant ‘Huguenots’ aimed to convert the entire nation. The Catholic aristocracy had no intention of recanting their faith and from 1562 until 1598 France was convulsed by a series of immensely bloody religious wars.   
       
    It wasn’t long before the struggle between Catholics and Protestants for control of Europe erupted into violence again. In 1618 the Thirty Years War began as a result of increasingly bitter sectarian disputes in the German princely states. The war would suck in almost every country in Europe and would devastate Germany to an extent not rivalled until 1945 It is estimated that at least 25% and perhaps 40% of the population of the German princely states perished as a result of the war. In fact the Thirty Years War was only the most bloody of a number wars and revolts inspired by sectarianism which convulsed Europe between 1519 and the start of the 18th century.  
       
    In addition to the numerous sectarian conflicts, between 1523 and the mid-17th century,5,000 men and women, both Catholic and Protestant, were executed as heretics in Western Europe; often they were burned alive or tortured to death. By the end of the 17th century the two sides of the religious divide had essentially fought themselves into an exhausted stalemate. A great arc of nominally protestant lands stretched from the Swiss Confederacy through Germany and Scandinavia in the north to England and Scotland in the West, with southern Europe largely staying loyal to Catholicism.  
       
    After almost two hundred years of bloodshed it had become clear that neither side in Europe’s religious divide could kill or persecute the other out of existence. Worship by Catholics in predominantly Protestant countries came to be tolerated if not accepted and some German towns were officially ‘bi-confessional’. In addition both the Protestant and Catholic churches had split into so many sub-sects that active persecution of those who did not follow the doctrine of a single church became impossible.   
       
    By the end of the 18th century religious pluralism became an unintended consequence of the Reformation with limited civil rights eventually granted to Catholics in England and Prussia and to Protestant sects in France and the Hapsburg Empire. In the diverse society of the 17th century Dutch Republic many Sephardic Jews fleeing persecution by the Spanish Inquisition began to settle, attracted by the Dutch Government’s disinterest in matters of private faith.  The contribution of Jews to the Dutch Republic’s commercial success prompted Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658)to allow their to return to England in 1657 over 350 years after their banishment from the British Isles.  
       
    The acceptance of multiple forms of belief in both Protestant and Catholic countries opened up the intriguing possibility that Government and religion could be separated and that spiritual belief could become a private affair.  
       
    From the 1620s onwards, small groups of religious minorities began to flee the persecution and religious violence they had experienced in England and Holland and joined thousands of other migrants and merchants to settle the wilderness of North America. Having escaped the sectarian bloodshed and persecution of their home countries these settlers carried with them a belief in the freedom of the individual to practice their own religion without interference from the state.  
       
    In the countries where Protestantism and Puritanism held sway shrines, idols, altars and pilgrimages were removed from religious worship. Where Puritans came to power music and dancing was banned and brothels were attacked as centres of sin. Protestantism upheld patriarchy as the basis for ordered society and Luther himself condoned a man’s right to beat his wife. The Reformation did not create modern Western society.  
       
    Participation in Pagan rituals and a belief in magic and spirits remained widespread across 17th century Europe in both Catholic and Protestant countries (as they still are across large parts of Africa and Asia). Rituals, relics and magical amulets were invariably linked to harvests, disease and fertility; in Germany it was common for young girls to be harnessed to a plough on Ash Wednesday.  
       
    The widespread belief in evil spirits could have particularly ugly consequences between 1560 and 1700 around 40,000 Europeans (mainly women) were put to death after being convicted of witchcraft. Although accusations of witchcraft were probably as old as humanity itself, the huge number of convictions for which craft during The Reformation appear to be related, if indirectly, to the upheavals and uncertainties of the period and were carried out by both Protestant and Catholic communities.  
       
    By the 1700s the increasingly widespread availability of scientific knowledge and the development of more sophisticated and humane justice systems together with the general disdain by the educate elite towards hysterical disputes between the peasantry led to the gradual disappearance of witchcraft trials by the 1700s. The true decline of belief in magic would come through the twin process of mass education and emergence of urban industrial life. Where people remained tied to the land ritual and magic lingered, even in the most advanced countries (Thomas Hardy could still write about pagan rituals in late 19th century rural Dorset).  
       
    The Reformation ushered in a more austere and perhaps purer form of spirituality. But Protestantism was not against art itself and even the fundamentalist Zwingli admired the beauty of secular art and only few extreme sects interpreted the second commandment has encompassing a blanket ban all pictures. Indeed Protestantism may have actually helped to spur the development of secular art, Hans Holbein (1497-1543) found patronage in the English Tudor court when the market for religious art dried up in his native Basel. Likewise in Calvinist dominated Holland, artists pioneered landscape pictures and depictions of everyday scenes, whilst Rembrandt van Ryn (1606-69) reimagined Old Testament stories as historical scenes. As a result, in Northern Europe at least, art became further removed from religion and became used as a medium to explore other aspects of the human experience.  
       
    The Reformation is a tale of dogmatic intolerance as well as the triumph of individual liberty and spiritual freedom. It took place alongside the opening up of the New World, the beginning of capitalism, revolutionary advances in science and the first tentative steps towards the separation of church and state.  
       
    It is true that the was more room for freedom of expression in Protestant Europe than in the Spain of the Inquisition, but many Protestant ministers continued to interpret the bible literally to right up to and beyond the publication of Darwin’s ‘On the Origin of Species’. Ultimately then the heirachy of Reformed Protestantism like Reformed Catholicism failed to adapt its theology to new scientific understanding and ultimately found itself left behind by mainstream Western society.  
       
    The greatest legacy of The Reformation was the establishment religious pluralism in society after decades of bloody violence aimed at enforcing a single religious dogma on the continent. By 1700 Europe had been exhausted by inconclusive internecine strife; to some extent, the fire had gone out of religious dogma and European states were increasingly aware of the riches and power that could be obtained through foreign trade and colonisation rather than endless religious conflict. In addition as Europeans had diversified into a spectrum of religious orders, the key component of society ceased to be a monopolistic religion but a greater emphasis on national identity and respect for a common law. Faith therefore became less a pre-requisite for national allegiance and more a matter of private spirituality.  
       
    In Britain, perhaps the most liberal state in the emerging Western world, a degree of civil emancipation and toleration had been achieved by 1700. Although far from today’s liberal society, a live-and-let-live attitude had come to prevail over the rigid doctrines of state, church and society that had often been brutally enforced over the previous centuries. As the English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) observed “Toleration has now at least been established by law in our country. Not perhaps so wide in scope as might be wished for by you and those like you who are true Christians and free from ambition or envy. Still, it is something to have progressed so far”.  
       
    As the 17th century gave way to the 18th, religion remained an important part of everyday life for most Europeans; it would continue to do so for many years to come. However, the upheavals of the 16th and 17th centuries took religious dogma out of the hands of a single central authority. Christianity could now be shaped by ordinary believers and made to respond the changing views of society. Europe was no longer defined by a single religious ideology, instead the continent began to also define itself by its secular distinctions from the rest of the world.  When in 1605 philosopher-politician Francis Bacon used the phrase “we Europeans” he was marking the emergence of a secular European identity.  
       
       
       
    Scientific Revolution   
       
    The night sky must have been a source of wonder for humans from the time that our ancestors on the African savannahs first gazed towards the heavens. The systematic study of the night sky was undertaken by every ancient civilisation. Although the movement of stars and planets across the heavens could be tracked and measured, no-one was able to explain the mechanics of precisely how the night sky worked.  
       
    Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543) was, for the greater part of his life, a canon at a cathedral church in Frauenburg in modern day Poland. Copernicus was a graduate of the European university network, having studied law in Bologna and medicine in Padua. Whilst at Bologna Copernicus first outlined his theory that earth orbited the sun. However, Copernicus was reticent about publishing such a controversial theory and it was only after the urging of his friends that in 1543, a year before his death, he published his thesis.   
       
    The theory was so revolutionary that there may only have been a dozen or so believers in Copernicus’ model for fully a century after its publication. Ultimately Copernicus’s ideas didn’t change the lives of his contemporaries: most scholars remained more interested in being able to follow the night sky rather than obtaining any deeper understanding of how it worked. Astrology retained an important influence in 16th century Europe, the English mathematician John Dee (1527 -1608/09) used astrological ideas to arrange the most propitious date for the coronation of Elizabeth I (this was the last time a British monarch consulted an astrologer before their coronation).  
       
    Aristotle had taught that the heavens beyond the moon (the super-lunar world) were fixed and unchanging and this view remained received wisdom for almost two thousand years. Then, one night in 1572, the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) was astonished to see a bright spot in the constellation of Caassiopia, where there should only have been empty night sky. Brahe was able to discern that this new star (stella nova as it was christened by Brahe) was an almost unimaginable distance away and firmly belonged to the supposedly unchanging super-lunar world. Brahe produced his own model of the universe which overturned some of the ideas of the ancient astronomers about bodies of the universe being fixed in place but retained the earth as being at the centre of everything.  
       
    At the same time as Brahe was observing the events taking place in the night sky Johannes Keppler (1571-1630) was puzzling over God’s meaning for the planetary system, as described by Copernicus. Kepler produced what he believed was a for the new model for the solar system, with the sun at its centre. Kepler and Brahe eventually worked together for the imperial court in Prague and further demolished ancient beliefs about the universe by proposing that planetary orbits followed and ellipse rather than a circle and endorsed the work of William Gilbert (1544-1603) who suggested that planets had magnetic properties which held the universe in places.  
       
    The discoveries of Kepler and Brahe had, incredibly, been achieved through naked-eye observation of the night sky and pure mathematical logic. Whilst the two astronomers worked out their theories the Italian mathematician Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) heard about a Dutch optical instrument known as an occhiale which allowed extremely distant objects to be viewed as though they were close up to the observer.   
       
    Galileo built an improved version for himself and when he turned it to the night sky he became the first human to record the structure of the universe as it appeared through a telescope. Galileo’s observations of Jupiter’s moons and Saturn, Mars and Venus convinced him of the veracity of Copernicus’s theories and continued the overturning of the Ancient Greek model of the universe. Galileo’s published his findings in the Starry Messenger (1610) and the medieval breakthroughs of the printing press and the university network meant that his ideas could be debated and investigated across a Europe-wide network of astronomers. Galileo’s ideas were endorsed by Jesuit astronomers and scientists of the church including Christopher Clavius (1538-1612) who devised the Gregorian Calendar which is still in use across the world today.  
       
    Despite remaining a believer, Galileo’s publication of his own theories ultimately brought him into conflict with the Catholic Church. This conflict was not, as it is often portrayed today, a simple matter of the Church versus scientific learning, indeed Galileo had received much support from members of the church hierarchy. The problem was that by endorsing the Copernican model of the universe, Galileo was unwittingly providing his own interpretation of the biblical description of universe. The Catholic Church had long jealously guarded its monopoly on the interpretation of biblical scriptures and in the early 17th century this monopoly was under threat from Protestantism with its emphasis on the importance of the individual interpretation of scripture.   
       
    Galileo had a number of run-ins with Church authorities but ultimately his stubborn refusal to countenance the Church’s model of the universe as having equal validity to the Copernican model led him to fall foul of Papal politics. It should be noted that, although placed under house arrest, Galileo went on to publish Two New Sciences, seen as his most important book, and was never convicted of being a heretic. Scientific inquiry continued in Catholic countries after Galileo’s imprisonment and it must be noted that a number of scientific breakthroughs would continue to be made in Catholic countries after Galileo’s death.   
       
    After the acrimony and tumult following caused by the radical reinterpretation of the universe’s structure, 17th century astronomers such as Piere Gassedi (1592-1655),Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) and Giovanni Cassini (1625-1712) observed previously unknown features of the solar system’s heavenly bodies (such as the discovery of Saturn’s ring system by Huygens in 1656). The Copernican system became widely accepted but after ancient theories on the universe had been displaced nobody could agree as to what kept the planets in place.   
       
    The French philosopher Renes Descartes (1596-1650) initiated a subtle shift in the thinking of European intellectuals by asking not ‘what is true?’ but instead ‘of what can I be certain?’. Descartes method of inquiry brought into question what evidence there was for his own existence. Descartes concluded that as he was could experience his own thoughts, he must exist as a person: ‘I think therefore I am’. Descartes extrapolated this logic to draw up mathematical models which might underpin the workings of the universe and everything in it. The theory was widely read and accepted by many contemporary thinkers including a young Isaac Newton (1643-1727).   
       
    Newton, a prodigiously gifted scholar, had studied Aristotelian ideas at Cambridge University and went on to read Descartes’ works. Newton later became influenced by the works of William Gilbert (1544-1603) who conducted experiments on spherical magnets from which he extrapolated that the entire earth was magnetic. Gilbert argued that this magnetism held the Copernican universe in place and as we have already seen, was a major influence on the model of the universe postulated by Keppler. Newton eventually developed the ideas and observations of Johannes Keppler (1571-1630) and Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) to derive the mathematical laws which governed Newton’s theory of gravity described in Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1687).  
       
    Newton remained convinced that all knowledge was derived from the ideas of the ancient philosophers: nevertheless, he had continued the erosion of ancient assumptions about the way the world work. Newton’s theory of gravity applied to everything from the sun to a mere apple; at a stroke overthrowing Aristotelian ideas about a divide between the superlunar and sublunar worlds.   
       
    Just as ancient ideas about the superlunar worlds was being replaced so too was the Aristotelian view of the sublunar world divided between two heavy elements (earth and water) and two light elements (air and fire). In 1638, whilst under house arrest, Galileo had published ‘Two New Sciences’, which demolished the Aristotle’s claim that heavier bodies fall to earth more quickly than lighter bodies. Two New Sciences expanded on this insight by developing mathematical models to determine the characteristics of different objects and thereby helping to create the new scientific discipline of physics.  
       
    Galileo’s pragmatic engineer-like approach to physics can be demonstrated by his work on projectiles which described their parabolic paths. Contemporaries of Galileo also turned their attention to the pumping of water. Evangelista Torrecelli (1608-47) who was to succeed Galileo as mathematician to the court Ferdinando II de Medici conducted experiments on air and water pressure which led to the invention of the barometer. Further experiments of the nature of air pressure were carried out by Blaise Pascal (1623-62) and Otto von Guericke (1602-86) which overturned the Aristotelian idea that air had no mass.  
       
    In England Robert Boyle (1627-91) who as the son of the richest man England was one of the first aristocratic gentleman scientists who would dominate the discipline for the next 200 years. Boyle began conducting his own experiments regarding the nature of air and his observations on the compressibility of air are still known as Boyle’s Law.   
       
    Aside from alchemy the earliest forms of chemistry had medicinal objectives. At the end of the medieval era all medieval though was based on works by Greek, Roman and Arabic authors which were invariably based on the belief that the human body contained four humors which needed to remain in constant balance and that astrology was an important factor in causing illness.   
       
    Starting with Theophrastus von Hohenheim (1493-1541) Western thinkers began to criticise ancient ideas about medicine and at the same time pioneered the emerging discipline of chemistry to create medicines. Despite the ideas of men like von Hohenheim approaches to medicinal treatments changed very gradually (although treatments determined by astrology waned over the course of the 17th century). Primitive modern surgery was pioneered by Ambroise Paré (c.1510–1590) and dentistry by Herman Boerhaave (1668–1738).   
       
    By contrast great breakthroughs were made in the subject of anatomy interest in the study of which developed dramatically over the 16th century. The Italian Andreas Visalius (1514-1564) produced the ground-breaking ‘On The Structure of the Human Body’ in 1543 which contained comprehensive drawings and diagrams depicting the dissection of the bodies of recently executed criminals. Visalius produced a second edition of the lavishly illustrated book that could be more cheaply printed and shared amongst medical students. Increasing interest in the subject led to the creation of special anatomy theatres, first in Italy but quickly in European other European cities too.   
       
    The English physician William Harvey (1578-1657) studied anatomy at the university of Padua was able to describe and demonstrate the circulation of blood around the human body, at once overturning ancient theories on blood. Four years after Harvey’s death, his associate Marcello Malpighi (1628-94) discovered that arteries and veins were linked by capillaries by using a revolutionary new instrument: the microscope.  
       
    Like the telescope the microscopes precise origins are unclear but by the 17th century it was being used to study the natural world by men such as Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) and Robert Hooke who were the first to study micro-biological organisms and describe the cellular structure of matter.  
       
    Study of the natural environment extended to the visible geographic features supposedly created by God during the act of creation. The concept of geology can be traced back to the Dane Nicolas Steno (1638-86) who after settling in Florence under the patronage of the Medicis in the 1660s began to take an interest in the stratified nature of rock in the Tuscan hills. Steno developed the idea that the different layers represented different eras of time which preserved a record of dramatic changes that had affected the earth.   
       
    The year Steno was born, a Jesuit polymath Athanathius Kircher (1602-1680) travelled to Sicily to study the recently active Mt Etna and concluded that the earth possessed a dynamic and complex internal structure. Kircher’s work laid the foundation stone of modern geology, although it was not until the 20th century that the earth’s internal structure was properly understood.  
       
    European intellectuals also began to take an scientific interest in nature during the 16th century. In medieval times there had been many learned books about flora and fauna but these books known as beasteries would often include commentaries on the presumed characteristics of animals (the cunning of a fox etc). As humanists took more interest in Greek works on medicines and herbal remedies a new wave of botanists began to produce scientific books about flora and fauna -including that of the New World - of which the ancient Greeks had had no knowledge. The cataloguing of known plants and the search for new species was driven by a search for new herb-based medicines and botanical gardens were founded in a number of European cities.  
       
    A number of other key breakthroughs science and mathematics occurred during the period of the ScientificRevolution - the Vernier Scale of measurement was invented by Pierre Vernier (1580–1637), the barometer by Evangelista Torricelli (1607–1647). Mathematical discoveries include the equality sign which was first used in 1557 by Robert Recorde (1512-1558) and Rafeal Bombelli (1526-1572), modern algebra notions were pioneered by Thomas Harriot Franciscus Vieta (1540–1603), Simon Stevin (1548/49 – 1620) pioneered the use of the decimal point, John Napier (1550–1617) invented logarithms, and Edmund Gunter (1581–1626) created the logarithmic scales upon which William Oughtred (1575–1660) developed the slide rule.  
       
    Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) invented the mechanical calculator in 1642 and co-founded probability theory with Pierre de Fermat, who also founded number theory. Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), built on Pascal’s work and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. Christiaan Huygens produced the first workable pendulum clock in 1656 and both he and Robert Hooke, independent and simultaneously invented the balance spring watch.   
       
    In 1676 the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer (1644-1710) made the first quantitative measurements of the speed of light and also invented the modern thermometer. Around 1730 John Hadley (1682–1744) and John Godfrey (1704-1749) simultaneously and independently invented the octant, the precursor to the sextant.  
       
    As well as breakthroughs in the emerging field of modern science, European craftsmanship had developed a world leading prowess in mechanical technologies. By the end of the Middle Ages large clocks had begun to be incorporated into cathedrals and the most important public buildings. Secular public buildings increasingly featured clocks and by the 17th century clock design had become so sophisticated that they were small enough to act as displays of wealth in the private homes of the rich.   
       
    The printing press had an impact of huge importance (perhaps akin to the impact of the internet in our own time). Scientific ideas and discoveries could be widely copied, disseminated, discussed and studied leading to new breakthroughs which could themselves be widely disseminated, studied and debated and so on. Clearly the printing press would only be of use if there was a shared community and culture interest in scientific inquiry. Western Europe had such a common culture which ended abruptly at the borders of the Islamic Ottoman Empire; there was little in the way of trade in peoples or ideas between the two civilisations until the mid-nineteenth century. It is notable that leading scientists of the time such as Copernicus, Harvey, Brahe and Keppler were also prepared to travel across Europe often around the city states of Italy but also to the increasingly powerful royal courts of Northern Europe.  
       
    Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries natural philosophers had formed groups in which to discuss their ideas with peers. A network of written correspondence also developed with key figures of the era exchanging lengthy written letters with their contemporaries across linguistic and emerging national boundaries, such networks were created and maintained by men known as intelligencers. The volume of correspondence could be overwhelming Nicholas-Claude Fabri de Peisric (1580-1637) disseminated Galileo’s ideas across France and left behind over 10,000 letters after his death, a not untypical number for an intelligencer. From Italy to France to England to Prussia, the natural philosopher created what humanists would coin a ‘republic of letters’.   
       
    The debating groups and networks gradually became more formalised and first scientific societies were established in Italy at the start of the 17th century and, amongst other things, promoted the works of Galileo and studies using the microscope. By the middle of the century scientific societies or academies had spread to Germany and France and by the 1650s a group of Oxford graduates including Robert Hook, Christopher Wren and Robert Boyle had formed the ‘Experimental Philosophy Club’. By 1662 it had received a royal charter and became known as ‘The Royal Society for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge’ which exists to this day. The fellows of the society held regular meetings in which experiments were conducted and their results presented and debated. This early form of peer reviewing became more formalised with the establishment in 1665 of the Philosophical Transactions, the world’s first scientific journal which published and reviewed work from across Europe.  
       
    The establishment of royal societies and academies and the increasing technological applications of scientific knowledge drove the increased formalisation and need for professionalism across the emerging scientific disciplines. By the 18th century scientific study had became a formalised subject in European universities and the study of science became a recognised and highly respected career.  
       
    Just as Charles II of England had granted the Royal Society its charter so too the French King Louis XIV (1638-1715) helped to instigate the formation of the Academie Royale des Sciences in 1666 as part of his efforts to harness arts and science for the benefit of the emerging French nation-state. The academicians were put to work in exploring ways to solve the thorny problem of establish longitude at sea and conducting the first accurate survey of France. The state provided the academicians with a library, a laboratory, an observatory and a botanical garden. A royal observatory was established in London in 1675 with expressed aim of ‘finding out the longitude of places for navigation and astronomy’.   
       
    The Catholic Church also had a role to play in the Scientific Revolution. Although it is now seen as an enemy of science and reason, the Church was not against the pursuit of scientific knowledge per se. Many early scientists were members of the church and the key personalities of the era, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, all remained devoutly religious. Indeed they devoted themselves to science in order to gain a greater understanding of God’s universe. However, The Scientific Revolution marked the beginning of man’s real ability to explain the universe and the end of Christianity’s claim to the divine nature of the universe. The Scientific Revolution, much more than the Reformation, marks the beginning of the Christianity’s evolution towards its contemporary role in the West as a source of personal and private spiritual solace rather than public influence.  
       
    The Scientific Revolution had broken the limits on human knowledge, much of which had not developed since Ancient Greece. It replaced the medieval view of the universe as unpredictable and subject to the whims of a capricious deity to a universe that was orderly, measurable and predictable and subject to immutable laws.    
       
    The breakthroughs in science and mathematics in the 16th century transformed humans’ understanding of the world and the universe.  The advancement of scientific inquiry on all fronts led to the founding of the scientific fields of anatomy, physics, chemistry, biology, botany, geology, mineralogy, mechanics, modern mathematics and modern medicine. The ordinary man or women would not have been directly affected by these scientific developments. But the revolution in science and mathematics paved the way for the development of technologies that continue to change the world to this day.  
       
    In June 1699, just 156 years after the publication of Copernicus’ theories a former military engineer named Thomas Slavery (1650-1715) demonstrated to the Royal Society an invention which after improvements would utterly transform the world: a prototype steam engine.  
       
       
    Europe between the Medieval and the Modern   
       
    Perhaps 80 or 90% of 16th century Europeans were illiterate rural peasants, living in agricultural poverty, always stalked by death and utterly untouched by the artistic patronage of European courts. Half of all children died before they reached their tenth birthday. Even for the wealthy, to reach fifty was to achieve an envious old age against all the odds. Having celebrated the end of his fiftieth year the philosopher Erasmus commented on his relief at having come to terms with death “as so few out of so many reach this age; I cannot rightly complain that I have not lived long enough”.  
       
    To add to the woes of the European commoner, the period between the 1540s and the 1640s saw painful increases in the prices of food as a result of inflation caused by the flood of silver from the New World and the still capricious nature of European harvests. In England the cost of living rose by a factor of seven during this period, a massive increase by the standards of the time.  
       
    However, small but important improvements were taking place, particularly in northern Europe. During the reign of Elizabeth I (1533-1603) more than 160 grammar schools were founded. In England in 1500 only 1 in 10 men could read, by the end of Elizabeth I’s reign that figure was 1 in 4; the percentage of literate women increased from 1% to 10%.  Late-Tudor England, together with the Netherlands were perhaps the most literate societies that had ever existed. The graduates of this expansion of humanist education included philosophers such as Erasmus (1466-1536) and Spinoza (1632-1677) who led the second wave of humanism across Northern Europe, at a time when that part of the continent was being torn apart by religious conflict.  
       
    Increased literacy led to the development of the novel, the first example of which, was Don Quixote in which Miguel de Cervantes’ (1547-1616) mocked outdated medieval attitudes. The most famous literary figure of the 16th century, William Shakespeare (1564-1616), was merely the greatest of a great community of contemporary English playwrights. Shakespeare’s works embody some of the key features of humanism: invariably eschewing religious and political dogma and focusing on what it means to be human.  
       
    Shakespeare’s works were of their time, mixing as they did themes such as the New World, religious conflict, racial and cultural differences and classical history. Although we know precious little about William Shakespeare, what we do know illustrates the real changes that were taking place under the surface in mainstream European societies. Shakespeare’s father was the medieval example of self-made man; a tradesman, wool dealer and money lender, and mayor of Stratford-upon-Avon, a small market town in the English midlands. A small number of documents survive relating to Shakespeare himself, including records of a court dispute and his own will, evidence of the spread of literacy, bureaucracy and record keeping into the minutiae of everyday life.  
       
    The works of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Homer, Ovid, Orace and Seneca could now be read by the ever growing number of educated Europeans. Successive generations of Europeans received an education based on ancient texts and grounded in humanist principles and were able to apply their knowledge to rational observation and inquiry of the world around them. Each time a breakthrough was made or a theory posited it could be printed, published, distributed read and discussed with unprecedented rapidity.  Dutch philosopher Renes Descartes’ (1596-1650) Discourse on Method (1637) built on the growing sense that the world could be controlled by man and that all aspects of the universe, including humanity, should be open to rational inquiry.  
       
    Magic and ritual superstition which seems to have been prevalent in all human societies came under prolong attack from European rationalism during the 17th century. Firstly the Scientific Revolution which began the process of demystifying the world and printing meant that that scientific findings and rational ideas about the world could be read by an exponentially increasing number of people. This was a period in which humans began to explore and chart the extent of the world, investigated the workings of the human body, observed the universe and began to work out the rules that kept it together.   
       
    Few ventures remained as risky and unpredictable in the 17th century as sea voyages, but Europeans began to develop ways of managing the risks associated with investing in the growing activity of global trade. Maritime insurance had been pioneered in medieval Genoa but in the coffeehouse of 17th century London the first sophisticated modern insurance contracts began to be drawn up. Edward Lloyd (1648-1713) set up Lloyds of London in the coffee house he owned in, the company dominates global maritime insurance to this day; in 1680, 14 years after the Great Fire of London Nicholas Barbon (1640-98) set up England’s first modern fire insurance company.  
       
    Just as European mindsets began tom drift from a medieval worldview of superstition and fatalism, the patchwork geographically amorphous medieval states had, by 1500, coalesced into the rough outlines of the modern nation states that make up the Atlantic seaboard of Europe today.   
       
    The British Isles held an advantageous position in late medieval Europe; the English channel meant it was isolated from continental wars but still allowed it to export wool and other commodities to the continent relatively easily. This prosperity and stability, accrued since the Norman conquest of 1066, meant that England was one of the most prosperous states in Europe in 1600 with a wealthy merchant class well represented in parliament.   
       
    Over the course of the 17th century England would emerge, together with the Netherlands as the first example of a European nation state with a recognisably modern constitution. The English Civil War (1642-51) and subsequent upheavals which culminated in the 1688 Glorious Revolution and 1701 Act of Settlement allowed the emergence of organised political parties and a rudimentary but robust English parliamentary democracy.  
       
    As in most other contemporary European countries the English Houses of Parliament acted as a semi-official assembly or advisory committee. It was largely made up of the country gentry; men whose families had accumulated land and wealth as result of the incremental increases in commerce and trade during the late-medieval period. Parliament became increasingly self-confident during the seventeenth century and in 1624 it ended the monarch’s prerogative to grant monopolies and patents. Charles I was crowned in 1625 and was soon suspected by parliament of favouring Catholic ministers. The ensuing row between the monarchy and a vociferously Protestant English gentry caused Charles to dissolve Parliament in 1628 only to be forced recall it and acknowledge its ancient rights under Magna Carta.   
       
    A supremely maladroit ruler Charles I (1600-1649), needed the assent of parliament to raise new tax, but tried to avoid this by raising revenue through his own rather dubious system of fines and taxes. Charles also implemented a system of fines for puritans who didn’t attend Anglican Church services and decreed that three gentleman convicted of criticising his perceived Catholicism should have their ears cut off. Neither action was likely to endear him to a puritan gentry class.  
       
    Charles was finally forced to recall the English parliament in 1640 in order to fund the suppression of a rebellion in Scotland and a group of parliamentarians expressed their grievances with state of matters he summarily dismissed parliament in a fit of pique at such lese-majeste. After a disastrous military defeat in Scotland Charles was inevitably compelled to recall parliament which took the opportunity to pass a series of laws strengthening its powers and preventing its dissolution by a monarch. After a dispute regarding suspected high-treason by a key advisor to Charles, relations between the monarch and his parliament broke down irrevocably. When the king accompanied by 400 soldiers attempted to arrest five parliamentarians, the speaker of the house refused to divulge their whereabouts; effectively committing his loyalty to the parliament of his country rather than his king.  
       
    After a particularly bloody four year war, beginning in 1642, parliament prevailed against the King’s forces and in January 1647 took custody of the King himself. By 1649 King Charles had been executed for treason against the state. In the absence of a ruler divined by God England became hotbed of radical ideas about society and the way it should be governed. Populist groups such as The Levellers and Diggers advocated far-reaching reforms whilst sections the Parliamentarian army called for a written constitution which would enshrine individual rights in law, including universal suffrage. In the end conservative forces held sway and the heady ideals gave way to a Commonwealth headed by Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) which survived barely seven months after his death before the monarchy was restored with the coronation of Charles II (1630-1685) in 1661.   
       
    When it became clear that Charles II’s successor James II was intent on clawing back the monarchy’s absolutist privileges parliament invited the Dutch statholder William of Orange (1650-1702) to rule as a constitutional monarch in 1688. William landed with his own army and claimed the thrown, forcing James II into exile but kept to his side of the agreement and ruled as a constitutional monarch. Parliament negotiated a new constitution with William and a new Bill of Rights was declared which barred the monarch from disbanding laws, confirmed parliamentary control over the matter of taxation and the need for parliamentary consent for a standing army. Individual liberty (habeas corpus) was established as fundamental principle of British society (England and Scotland were united in 1707), and there was a limited extension of religious tolerance, freedom of expression and a free press, with political periodicals such as the Spectator making their debuts.   
       
    The the ascendancy of parliament was confirmed in the 1689 Bill of Rights which enshrined the concept of freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary taxation in law.  Parliament had oversight of royal expenditure. Property rights became more secure and economic institutions more inclusive, providing real incentives for entrepreneurs and investors. The monarchy’s grip on economic life which had been under gradually increasing pressure since the Black Death was finally removed. In the coming century private investment in canals, roads and railways created the infrastructure that would facilitate rapid economic growth.   
       
    Whilst political evolution of European states would continue to be dominated by events rather than abstract theories, it was clear that there was an alternative of absolute monarchies, even in states as large and as populous as England.   
       
    Several intellectuals emerged from the political turbulence of 17th century England to publish their ideas on the best way to organise society and national Government.   
       
    John Milton (1608-1674) is better known today for his epic poem ‘Paradise Lost’ but in the turbulent years following the civil war he produced numerous pamphlets proposing an early form of secular, liberal Government. Milton’s liberal ideals were expounded by John Locke (1632-1704) who in ‘Two Treatises of Government’ described the rights of an individual to preserve their own “Life, health, Liberty, or Possessions” and that the balance of individual rights in society should be negotiated by a social contract between the state and the people it governed, to that end Locke envisioned that a rulers powers should be held in check to prevent the emergence of tyranny. Locke’s contemporary Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) also proposed a theory of social contract between the states and the masses, not to preserve individual freedoms, but to prevent society from disintegrating into anarchy. Unlike Locke, Hobbes proposed that the social contract should be presided over by a strong sovereign. What influence these writers had on the turn of events is difficult to discern but, in a typically British way, the 1701 Act of Settlement which formalised a constitutional monarchy was, in some ways, a happy marriage of the two theories.  
       
    Across 17th century Europe, the beginnings of a mass press began to emerge with the first recognisably modern newspapers entering circulation, two of which - Post- och Inrikes Tidningar in Sweden and Opregte Haarlemsche Courant - are still published today. By 1850 more than half of all Europeans are thought to have been literate with literacy levels close to modern levels by 1914 over this time an independent media would become one of the cornerstones of Western culture across Europe and the United States.  
       
    By 1700 the wars of religion had largely petered out to be replaced by an uneasy and rather grudging acceptance of religious pluralism across the territories marked and scored by the Reformation. The previously contentious ideas of the Scientific Revolution, that the earth was not the centre of the universe and that the universe itself was governed by rational and calculable laws, had largely been accepted and science was slowly developing into a profession its own right with fields in physics, chemistry, biology and geology.   
    For ordinary people, however, the 17th century ended largely as it had begun. Most people still lived as rural smallholders, and continued to be stalked by the ever present threat of disease, hunger, poverty and death. Average life expectancy across the century fluctuated from around 24 to around 35 depending on the prevalence of famine and plague. In France a particularly brutal famine at the end of the century killed an estimated 1.3 million people, out of a population of around 22 million. Superstition and ritual were not totally eliminated from European life and in the British colony of Massachusetts 20 people, mainly women, were hanged for witchcraft in 1693 in a final bout of superstitious hysteria and the last mass trial of its type in the West.  
    By 1700 the world had been circumnavigated and mapped, the structure of the heavens and the microscopic world had been observed, and the first tentative steps had been taken towards capitalism and democracy; yet the minds, and the lives, of Europeans themselves were still undergoing the long painful process of becoming civilised.  
       
    The Age of Enlightenment  
       
       
    By the year 1700 the superstitions and dogma of medieval society and the misconceptions of the Ancient World had been overturned. New Worlds had been discovered, great oceans traversed,the movement of the heavens observed and tracked in unprecedented detail.  
       
    The 18th century marked the end of the age of enchantment and superstition; European intellectuals would be at the forefront of shaping ideas on how society should be run in the future.  
       
    The works of Europe’s great 18th century philosophers coalesced around an emphasis on liberty, constitutional Government, rational enquiry, humanity and secularism. Together these philosophical ideas and continued scientific developments in the wake of the Scientific Revolution led to the 18th century being christened as the Age of Enlightenment.  
       
    The Age of Enlightenment above all else represented a belief in social progress and the improvement of mankind through the reform of society and its institutions, and continued scientific enquiry. Like the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment relied on positive feedback loops which spread across Western Europe and the fledgling North American colonies.  
       
    The Age of Enlightenment carried on from where the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century had left off. In 1729, Stephen Gray (1666–1736) demonstrated that electricity could be "transmitted" through metal filaments. The first electrical storage device was invented in 1745, the "Leyden jar” was invented simultaneously and independently by Georg von Kleist (1700-1749) and Pieter van Musschenbroek (1692 –1761)  and in 1749, Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) demonstrated that lightning was a form of electricity.   
       
    The basic elements of the atmosphere were discovered during the late 18th century. In 1766, Henry Cavendish (1731–1810) discovered hydrogen and in 1774, Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) discovered oxygen. Joseph Black (1728-1799) discovered carbon dioxide and  in 1761 and went on to describe the theory of latent heat which would greatly aid the development of the steam engine and laid the foundation for the study of thermodynamics. Frenchman Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) established the formal discipline of chemistry when he developed his law of Conservation of mass in 1789, also called Lavoisier's Law. Antoine Lavoisier also proved that burning was caused by oxidation and also proved that diamonds were made of carbon and argued that all living processes were at their heart chemical reactions.   
       
    German explorer Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) published a series of early works that would help establish the fields of biology and geography and would help inspire Charles Darwin amongst many others. In the field of astronomy the breakthroughs of the Scientific Revolution were verified and built upon. European scientists travelled to locations across the world to observe the 1761 transit of Venus and the mathematician Alexis Claude de Clairaut (1713-1765) was able to calculate the mass the planet. De Clairaut also observed that the plant earth formed the shape of a oblate ellipsoid, an important step in proving theories proposed by Newton a century earlier. James Bradley (1693-1762) confirmed the heliocentric nature of the universe and in 1781 William Herschel (1738-1822) discovered Uranus using a powerful homemade telescope.  
       
    Accompanying the technological breakthroughs that occurred throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries was the establishment of an increasingly sophisticated financial system in Northern Europe.  
       
    The ideas of Adam Smith (1723-1790), David Ricardo (1772-1823), David Hume (1711-776)  and others had a decisive impact on the economic policy of the British Government in the 18th century and the gradual move away from mercantilism and towards free markets. Monopolistic practices were progressively rolled back over the course of the century and the lobbying power of guilds diminished.  
       
    The century after Adam Smith published the Wealth of Nations saw a rapid growth in the number and sophistication of banks in England.  Highly specialised banks concentrated solely on trans-Atlantic trade, there were also bill-discounting banks which facilitated trade between different banks and merchants. The Bank of England gradually emerged as a prototype central bank with a monopoly on the issuing of bank notes. European countries followed Britain’s lead with the Banque de France established in 1800 and the German Reichsbank founded in 1875. By 1833 Britain scrapped the old usury laws which had prohibited the charging of interest for religious reasons. Within two hundred years the western world had created a system of trade, banking and finance which was unparalleled in sophistication.  
       
    In parallel with the increasing sophistication of financial markets a dedicated insurance market which had been tentatively developed in the 1680s became increasingly professionalised. The first insurance underwriters simply relied on ensuring that they received more than they paid out – little more than a gamble. In the 18th century an insurance market based on logic and risk probability. Edmund Halley (1656-1741) produced the first comprehensive analysis of life expectancy using data from the Prussian town of Breslau and drawing on Blaise Pascal’s theories about probability – thus giving the odds of a man of a certain age dying in a given year.   
       
    In 1705 Swiss mathematician Jacob Berrnoulli (1655 – 1705) proposed his Law of Large Numbers which stated that the certainty of a proposition being true could be inferred from a selected sample of data. In 1738 his nephew Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) published ‘Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk’ which discussed the ideas of economic utility and risk aversion. Mathematicians Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754) and the Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes (1701-1761) further developed theories on probability.   
       
    Using the new theories on probability a Scottish Presbyterian minister named Alexander Webster (1708-1784) to propose that his fellow ministers should contribute to a fund to be profitably invested and the proceeds from which could be used to take care of their widows and orphans. In order for the fund to be effective Webster proposed a calculation of the probable number of orphans and widows who would require assistance and how much money they would need to support them. Together with his friend Robert Wallace (1691-1771) they drew on theories of probability and Edmund Halley’s work on life expectancy to estimate the fund that was likely to be needed to pay for the care of widows and orphans of Scottish ministers. Within 20 years similar funds had been setup from Philadelphia to London.   
       
    The Enlightenment was not only an age of science, mathematics and commerce: it was also an era in which important ideas about the structure of modern society began to be debated actively.  
       
    The liberal philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) argued for equal rights between the sexes and advocated the participation of women in Government. Similarly Nicolas de Condorcet (1743-1794) a leading liberal republican figure in the French Revolution was a pioneering, if unsuccessful, proponent of female suffrage. leading this was the emergence of women as high-calibre intellectuals in the public sphere.  Important though the fact that leading male intellectuals had begun to seriously argue for the equality of rights of the sees was, feminism as an idea cannot, almost by definition, have begun until females themselves were able to argue that she should be treated as equal citizens.   
       
    Mary Woollsencroft (1759-1797) whose middle-class upbringing allowed her access to a classical education lived an unconventional lifer for her times. Woolsencroft was inspired by the events of the French Revolution to write and publish ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Men’ in defence of the Revolution. In 1792 Woolsencroft published ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Women’ in which she essentially took Enlightenment to its logical conclusion by arguing that women were human beings and were therefore entitled to the same natural human rights as men.   
       
    However, the lives of most women did not fundamentally change during the Enlightenment and the novels of Jane Austen (1775-1815) explore the importance of marriage in securing a future for middle class women of the time. Female liberty would not emerge in Europe until many years later and only after the upheaval of the Industrial Revolution, however, the intellectual roots of feminism can be traced back to ideas first debated during the Enlightenment.  
       
    Enlightenment thinkers had less to say on the treatment of different races by Europeans and in particular the ongoing Atlantic slave trade. Although, imperialism and slavery were in direct contradiction to the principles of the Enlightenment, it was not a cause celebre amongst the major secular philosophers. Many conscientious Europeans decried the slave trade during the eighteenth century but the most successful lobbyists for abolition were driven by Christian, rather than secular conscience.  
       
    Between 1530 and 1830 it is estimated that between 10 and 15 million African slaves were transported across the Atlantic to the Americas by European merchants. Perhaps two million slaves did not survive the brutal crossing of the Atlantic. Mortality rates for those survived the crossing to fulfil their destiny as slaves of the western system of trade are unknown but the life expectancy of a slave in the Caribbean colonies especially was certainly pitifully short - for many death life simply meant enduring punishments included flogging and mutilation.  
       
    During the 18th century the existence of the Atlantic slave trade became an increasingly troublesome issue for right-thinking intellectuals influenced by the Enlightenment ideals of liberty and equality as well as for Europe’s evangelical protestants and Catholic thinkers. In the 1780s and 1790s a number of northernmost states in the newly independent United States of America outlawed slavery in their jurisdictions, in 1787 Sierra Leone was founded by Britain as a colony for freed slaves and in the 1790s Denmark, Norway, post-revolutionary France and the colony of Canada banned slavery on their territories and possessions.   
       
    But it was to be the UK the state that with its powerful navy and merchant fleet had driven the growth of trans-atlantic slave trading that firmly established a prohibition on the trading of slaves and enforced measures to eradicate its existence across the world. William Wilberforce (1759-1833) was born in the English port of Hull is 1759 to a wealthy family whose prominence allowed him to become a member of parliament at the age of 21.   
       
    Wilberforce was motivated by a deep religious conviction to use his political position to act as a standard bearer for the cause of abolition and spent more than two decades trying to pass an abolition bill through the houses of parliament, both of which were populated by an aristocratic elite with deep vested interests in the slave trade. With the help of a number of other politicians and influential individuals, a bill was eventually passed in 1807 prohibiting the involvement of British ships or subjects in the slave trade. Almost simultaneously the United States passed legislation prohibiting any further importation of slaves (but leaving individual states free to allow slavery to continue within their respective jurisdictions).   
       
    A number of other European and South American states passed legislation abolishing the trading of slaves in the following two decades. Slaves held in British colonies and possessions were not officially freed until 1838. By 1845 Britain had assigned 36 ships to its anti-slavery squadron to suppress the slave trade across the world.   
       
    Almost alone in the West, the United States retained slavery in its southern states. Its final reckoning with its original sin was put off until the 1860s, when at huge cost it would finally be confronted and vanquished.  
       
    Although a deep belief in Christianity drove William Wilberforce and men like him to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade, the 18th century marked the start of the West’s, or at least Western Europe’s, gradual drift towards a looser relationship with religion in general and Christianity in particular.   
       
    The doctrines of the Roman Catholic church were brought into sharp focus under the examination by an intellectual Enlightenment culture of inquiry. In his epic Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Edward Gibbon (1737-1792) caustically commented of the Christian scriptures “The only defect of these pleasing compositions is the want of truth and common sense” Voltaire mocked the papacy and Christian dogma, David Hume applied his sceptical philosophy to demolish the argument that Creation described by scripture was evidence in itself for the existence of an omnipotent God and Baron d’Holbach denied the existence of God entirely.   
       
    The eventual acceptance of religious pluralism that emerged by the 17th century served to splinter the religious doctrine and sexual and social morals. The ideas of the Enlightenment gradually emerged to fill this vacuum.  
       
    The primacy of individual conscience over religious or moral injunction was by 1750 already taken for granted by Samuel Johnson: ‘that every man should regulate his actions by his own conscience, without any regard to the opinions of the rest of the world, is one of the first precepts of moral prudence’. At the same time it had come to be more widely accepted that punishment could not create private penitence and the view that education and charity provided the true path to redemption became conventional wisdom.  
       
    Western society became noticeably less fatalistic about epidemics of plagues and disease and gradually stopped seeing them as divine punishment for man’s sins. Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802), grandfather of Charles, considered it absurd to suppose that the Devil created disease and unfeasible to believe that God deliberately created such wanton suffering. When inculcation against smallpox was achieved in Britain as a result of the work of Edward Jenner, it was only opposed by extreme Calvinist communities in Scotland who clung to the belief that disease was the result of predestination. Similarly Enlightenment doctors abandoned the ancient belief that mental illness was a sign of diabolical possession and uneducated peasant midwives began to be replaced by professional doctors. Witchcraft trials slowly died out during the course of the 18th century, as did the practice of torture by the state to extract confessions from criminals. Governments began to take more concern regarding the welfare of citizens, in 1777 John Howard (1726-1790) proposed a series of reforms to the English prison system designed to make them more humane and safer for prisoners.work of English Quakers and Evangelicals.  
       
    Many Enlightenment philosophers, including those critical of the church, retained their faith and even promoted personal piety. But it was into this world of free thought, widespread literacy and pluralistic philosophies they had helped to create that men such as Charles Darwin were born and raised. Men who would in their own time produce intellectual works which accelerated the steady side-lining of the church from the realm of human enquiry and knowledge.  
       
    Religious influence also declined in the realm of art during the 18th century; whereas the Renaissance and the Baroque movements had been driven by commissions for the church and wealthy patrons idea of art as a representation of culture also found acceptance during the Enlightenment. Late 18th century movements such as Romanticism ledgy painters such as Francisco de Goya (1746-1828), John Constable (1776-1831), and J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) looked to appreciate the beauty of nature through art as an end in itself establishing a new phase in European art. Music too became an important element of Enlightenment culture and the invention of the violin, cello, piano, clarinet and other instruments allowed the development of orchestral music and the concept of tonality (the playing of music in a particular key) which remains a key concept of modern western popular music. George Frederic Handel (1685-1759), J.S. Bach (1685-1750), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827), Franz Shubert (1797-1828) and dozens of other composers contributed pieces which remain as examples of high European art through to the modern day and established music as a key art form in European culture.  
       
    The Enlightenment was not only an age of science, mathematics and commerce, it was also an era in which important ideas about the structure and governance of society began to be debated more openly than at any time since the Athenian Golden Age.  
       
    The three giants of Enlightenment thought on natural human rights were the near contemporaries: Voltaire (1694-1778), Montesquieu (1689-1755) and Rousseau (1712-1778). All three were heavily influenced by the Glorious Revolution and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in England in 1688. Voltaire took up the cause of those victimised and unjustly persecuted by Church and state. Rousseau meanwhile declared in 1762 that “Man is born fee; and everywhere he is in chains”. Following on from this declaration in ‘The Social Contract’ Rousseau argued that the state should not act to unjustly repress the rights of citizens; instead he argued, the state should derive its legitimacy from the people it represents and should strive to act on their behalf. Such powerful arguments regarding the role of the state and the fundamental rights of individual citizens became highly influential in European intellectual thought and would play an important role in the landmark revolutions that would take place in America and France thirty years later.  
       
    The proximate causes of the American Revolution of 1789 was the widespread anger amongst inhabitants of the thirteen colonies at the imposition of taxes by the British parliament without their consent. Anger at taxes seen as harsh or high-handed was not a new phenomenon, nor was armed rebellion against as Government seen as exploitative and unrepresentative. What made the American Revolution transformative was the type of society that rebel colonies explicitly sought to create.  
       
    The English Civil War in the 17th century had already established the primacy of parliament over the monarchy, but the Roundhead victors had stopped short of establishing society in which the equality of rights of all men and women were enshrined  in law. By contrast the representatives of the thirteen colonies who met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1776 produced the Declaration of Independence, ostensibly intended as a legal document asserting the independence of the colonies, but with a preamble containing one of the most profound and important sentences in Western history:  
       
    “We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness”  
       
    The document’s author, Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), was clear that he did not consider that the Declaration contained any original ideas; they were all concepts that had been proposed and discussed by Enlightenment intellectuals and the Declaration itself had been influenced by the English Declaration of Rights of 1689. Whereas the English Declaration of Rights had established the basic minimum civil rights for its citizens, the Declaration of Independence explicitly set out the principle that, not only were all men born equal, but that they all had the freedom - indeed the right - to pursue their own dreams of happiness.  
       
    The implementation of these pure ideals was far from perfect, to be sure. The continuation of the enslavement of blacks in the new nation (and by the signatories of the Declaration) was the most notable example of the new society’s failure to confront full ramifications of its stated self-evident truths.  
       
    Nonetheless the thirteen colonies had succeeded in establishing a new society in which the rights of its citizens to pursue live free and happy lives were enshrined in law. The principles set out in the Declaration and the successful establishment of the United States of America as a Republican democracy could not fail to influence the adherents of Enlightenment principles who railed against the shackles of the absolutist regimes in which they lived.  
       
    Thirteen years after the thirteen colonies declared independence from their colonial ruler, events in France brought Enlightenment ideas of liberty and republicanism back to the centre of a European continent still dominated by absolute monarchs.  
       
    In the summer of 1789 the absolutist Bourbon dynasty found it itself facing bankruptcy and was forced to call the first meeting of the Estates General since 1614 in order to gain approval for a new tax law.   
       
    The Estates General was a general assembly representing the interests of the clergy, the aristocracy and the country’s richest merchants and landowners and was therefore a powerful force, even in the realm of an absolutist monarch. Over the previous decades, discontent with the prevailing state of affairs had been simmering across France and the Estates General turned itself into its own national assembly claiming its own sovereignty separately from the king. Such was the general level of discontent across the French peasantry that a series of revolts occurred across the nation, the most famous of which was the storming of the Government fortress in Paris, la Bastille.  
       
    The new National Assembly worked swiftly through the summer of 1789, first abolishing feudalism and then publishing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. Directly influenced by Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence, the French declaration built upon its American predecessor and echoed the concept that humans were born with universal human rights and that power derived from the consent of the people.  
       
    The French Revolution descended into bloody political terror, execution of the King and Queen, counter revolutions, political massacres, civil war and international wars that plagued Europe’s most populous nation for the best part of 20 years. From the chaos arose Europe’s first military dictator, Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) a brilliant mid-ranking artillery officer was able to exploit the chaos and his own military genius to crown himself Emperor of France and embark upon a series of imperial wars.   
       
    The French Revolution did not lead to the peaceful establishment of a constitutional republic as had happened in America but the impacts of the revolution were just as far reaching. Western Europe’s most powerful state had overthrown the concept of absolute monarchy and feudalism, the Catholic Church and the aristocracy had been defenestrated. The national assembly had established the concept of universal human rights and constitutional Government and a code of civil law, the Code Napoleon, established a set of secular rules by which the post-feudal society could be established. Indeed, as a result of Napoleon’s European conquests, the Code Napoleon formed the basis of the civil rule of law used in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Western Europe. Together with the anglo-saxon system of common law, it meant that Western states from the American West to the River Oder had established legal systems established a secular code of rules for society and which were, in principle, independent from interference by the state. The rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, although often severely tested, remains one of the defining characteristics of Western civilisation.  
       
    By 1800 Britain had refined a system of parliamentary Government, the United States and France had established written constitutions which enshrined the concepts of universal human rights and power derived from the consent of the Governed and the continental Western European states had established the secular rules by which civil society could be run.  
       
    The Enlightenment ideas fomented during the 18th century had however broken the medieval principle of divinely ordained rule claimed by monarchs. The Enlightenment had conclusively established that all citizens possessed human rights which were unalienable and universal. Even if the political revolutions of the 18th century did not meet their own lofty aims, they laid the foundations for the citizens who were to be born into this brave new world.  
       
    The Enlightenment marked a watershed in European intellectual thought. Although it was an elite movement whose impact may not have been immediately felt by ordinary 18th century European men and women, it essentially laid the foundations for the values we recognise today as representing Western civilisation.  
       
       
    The Industrial Revolution  
       
    In 1798 the economist Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) published ‘An Essay on the Principle of Population’ in which he observed that when living standards in a population rose, so too did the birth rate. As the birth rate increased, so too did the supply of labour and the consumption of limited resources, creating a deflationary effect on wages at a time of inflation in the price of goods. The net result of these pressures was a collapse in living standards and consequently, the birth rate, as workers could not afford to get married and start families until later in life.  
       
    Malthus’ observations have since become known as the ‘Malthusian Trap’. His theory was valid at the time he was writing, and arguably the Malthusian Trap offers an explanation for the levels of poverty experienced by modern pre-industrial countries which have experienced rapid population growth (and this phenomenon may have been one of the causes of the Arab Spring).  
       
    However, what Malthus could not have known was that at the very time he was writing his essay, Britain was undergoing an Agricultural Revolution which would revolutionise the supply of food and allow Britain to sustain a major population boom. The increased productivity caused by the Agricultural Revolution allowed the migration of surplus labour from the agricultural sector to the new industrial sector. As a result of the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions Britain became the first society in history to break the Malthusian trap end enjoy sustained material improvements in living standards.  
       
    By 1750 Britain probably already had the most productive agricultural system in world history, further improvements were made with the Enclosure Acts that consolidated peasants’ ancient subsistence plots into a patchwork of commercially farmed fields. Marshes were drained by engineers, animals were selectively bred to increase yields, crop rotation systems were established, and new crops such as the potato allowed greater diversification. in 1700 Jethro Tull invented the seed drill which marked the start of the process of mechanisation in modern farming (although it would be some time before a cheap and reliable model was developed). The commercialisation of farming attracted business investment which drove a virtuous cycle of improved returns and further investment.  
       
    Although bad harvests and even famines could and did occur in Europe right up to the mid-19th century, improvements in agriculture meant that famine was a much rarer phenomenon and harvests became increasingly reliably and productive. 18th century European farmers were able to achieve a yield two or three times that of their medieval predecessors and during the 19th century yields grew by at least 1% per year - a lasting improvement in yields that was truly revolutionary.  
       
    The improvements in agriculture that took place in Britain during the 18th century meant that fewer workers needed to work the land and could provide a labour force for the Industrial Revolution which was showing signs of emerging by the mid-18th century. Communities which for millennia had consisted of peasants and craftsmen would over no more than 150 years be transformed into towns and cities of salaried industrial workers and office workers.  
       
    The ‘classical’ period of the Industrial Revolution is widely agreed to have occurred between around 1760 and 1830. In essence it involved a series of technological breakthroughs that allowed for a dramatic increase in productivity and reduction in prices. It also greatly increased the number of products available for mass consumption and created a new way of organising labour, primarily centred around the factory system. Importantly after the initial technological breakthroughs there was a continual process of new inventions, improvements and developments in technology, industry, and the organisation of labour, which acted to increase productivity.  
       
    The Agricultural Revolution was partly driven by capital investment and there had been a gradual accumulation of capital in Britain since the late Middle Ages. Canals were an ancient invention but were rediscovered by early capital investors, or ‘capitalists’, in 18th century Europe as a means of transporting bulky goods such as coal to markets. The canal network established, first in France and then in England, greatly improved the returns for capitalists, especially mine owners. The reduction in the price of coal due to lower transportation costs had other effects on the economy. Blast furnaces had been used in Europe since 1400 but only the widespread adoption of coal as a fuel made the production of iron possible at a price that was not prohibitively expensive.  
       
    The 18th century also witnessed a number of landmark technological breakthroughs which drove exponential increases in productivity. Broadly speaking the key developments where in the use of steam power to drive machinery which in turn increased productivity, in textiles the power loom used steam power to increase the productivity of a worker by a factor of 40 and improvements in the design of blasts furnaces allowed the mass production of cheaper, higher-quality iron.   
       
    The initial developments in steam engines were made, by and large, by working-men who were also amateur engineers. Denis Papin (1647–1712) was best known for his pioneering invention of the steam digester, the forerunner of the steam engine, Thomas Newcomen (1664–1729) perfected a practical steam engine for pumping water from coal mines in northern England. Around the same time Abraham Darby I (1678–1717) developed a method of producing high-grade iron in a blast furnace fuelled by coke rather than charcoal, allowing machinery to be developed on a much larger scale. Developments and improvements were made to Newcomen’s steam engine so that it could also be used to aid water wheels and blast furnaces. Notably, James Watt (1736-1819) improved the design so far that it could produced cheaply and efficiently for uses in numerous industries and could drive machinery without the need for water wheels.  
       
    As capital for investment in mining and other industrial endeavours accumulated during the 1700s, a series of technological developments in the last half of the century came to characterise the early industrial economy. For the first time large groups of workers where employed to work in a single building, operating rows of machines that produced items at a rate of production vastly greater than that accomplished by the most skilled artisans. This new method of working was pioneered by Richard Arkwright (1732-1792) whose new factory in Cromford, Derbyshire enabled cotton cloth to be manufactured more cheaply than eve before. The technology used in Arkwright’s factory was copied and improved by entrepreneurs and by the early 1800s a loose network of cotton factories existed across Lancashire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire.  
       
    At the same time as the cotton factories were being established across the north of England, entrepreneurs were making technological breakthroughs that would allow the emergence of other new industries. Abraham Darby III (1740-1789) continued the pioneering work of his father and grandfather, who had developed the techniques for smelting cast iron on a large scale, by building the world’s first cast iron bridge in 1777. In 1828 James Beaumont Neilson (1792 – 1865) refined the iron smelting process when he invented the hot-blast method of iron ore smelting. Benjamin Huntsman (1704-1776) developed a method for manufacturing cast steel in the 1740s which enabled the production of steel on large-scale. These developments meant that metal goods could be manufactured to a much higher standard for a much lower price; the resulting development of machinery tools added a further spur to the crystallising industrial revolution.  
       
    Further developments were made in the field of chemicals with John Roebuck (1718-1794) inventing a process for creating sulphuric acid, and Nicolas Leblanc (1742-1806) and Charles Tennant (1768-1838) inventing a process for producing sodium carbonate and bleaching powder respectively. As with the manufacture of metals, the manufacture of chemicals provided a further spur to industrial revolution by enabling further developments in glass, textile, soap, and paper industries.   
       
    Importantly for this period of growth driven by entrepreneurial risk taking and technological advancements, Britain maintained a stable and benign political environment which was supportive of liberal business enterprises and in which the rule of law was fundamental. Unlike in most other countries, the British Government did not maintain monopolies in most internal trades and the profit motive drove entrepreneurs such as Richard Arkwright, and the Birmingham businessman Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) who entered into a highly profitable partnership with the James Watt.  
       
    The capacity to produce large numbers of high-quality goods at low prices precipitated a consumer revolution in 18th century Britain. Entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) established successful businesses dedicated to providing consumer goods. Wedgwood even established the concept of consumer marketing with advertising, travelling salesmen, and introductory offers - middle class consumers who purchased his products could boast they were using the same stoneware as that supplied to the royal family.  
       
    Of course for these increasingly cheap, high-quality products to reach consumers they had to be transported around Britain and across the world. Like most European countries after the fall of the Roman Empire, Britain had no centralised transport network and those roads  that did exist were maintained in a haphazard manner, if at all. Initially canals were built to transport bulky manufactured goods and raw materials while turnpike roads were improved by  being ‘macadamised’, the innovative construction design invented by John Macadam (1756-1836). Both canals and macadamised toll roads were made possible by legislation enacted by parliament keen to assist the development of trade and private enterprise. However, the standout development of this initial stage of the industrial revolution was a mode of transport that still transports hundreds of millions of people all over the world every single day.   
       
    The establishment of a railway network in England in the 1830s was a creation borne of all the features of the Industrial Revolution which had occurred in the previous 80 years. The first steam railway engine, Puffing Billy, was created to haul coal from a colliery in Yorkshire so that it could be distributed to feed the mills and workshops of northern England. The design of the engine was facilitated by the breakthroughs in metalwork and steam engines and the most famous engine prototype, ‘Rocket’ was developed by the father and son team of George (1781-1848) and Robert Stephenson (1803-1859); self-taught engineers like so many of the giants of the early Industrial Revolution.   
       
    Such was the burgeoning pool of talent in England at that time that the Rainhill Trials, the competition won by the Stephenson's ‘Rocket’ engine, featured entries from five different teams for a machine that was not conceived of anywhere outside of Europe. Rocket ran along the Liverpool and Manchester railway, the world’s first passenger railway, which was opened in 1830. By the end of that decade, Britain had gone from having a single railway line to a nearly complete national rail network. This first truly modern transportation network heralded the end of transition of Britain - and soon afterwards, Europe - from a pre-industrial society to the what we now recognise as an embryonic modern economy.   
       
    Railways allowed manufactured goods, raw materials and perishable foodstuffs to be transported to consumers at much greater speed and much lower cost, led directly to standardised time zones - Greenwich Meantime was adapted as the standardised time across Britain in 1847 - and enabled ordinary citizens to cross great distances at unprecedented speeds. Steam power was also quickly adapted for use by ships and in 1838 the S.S. Great Western, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-1859), made the first crossing of the Atlantic under steam power, at a stroke shrinking the travelling time between Europe and the Americas.  
       
    In popular memory, and according to many political dogmas, the Industrial Revolution led to the ruthless exploitation of an impoverished and powerless labouring class by uncaring capitalists. It is a world immortalised in the works of Charles Dickens (1812-1870) and Fredrich Engels (1820-1895). By the time of Dickens’ and Engels’ most famous writings on the labouring poor in the 1840s it was clear that the industrial revolution had wrought massive changes on British society, changes bigger than anything since the agrarian revolution at the very start of written history.  
       
    GDP growth is difficult to measure but it can be reasonably concluded that global GDP had seen only  negligible increases since establishment of settled civilisations. Modest growth occurred in Europe between 1400 and 1700 but between the 1750s and the 1850s a marked growth in European GDP had occurred, with British GDP perhaps doubling in 100 years from $1000 per capita in 1750 to $2000 per capita in 1850. How much of this GDP increase resulted in wage increases for the average worker is difficult to measure, but most historians argue there were at least modest increases over the course of this 100 year period. In addition access to workers to commodities such as cotton clothes, utensils, cheaper food and drink and better housing is likely to have been an outcome of the advances of the period.  
       
    What can be stated with some certainty is that the population of Britain doubled between 1750 and 1850. Even in a modern state such a rate of population growth would put severe pressures on the availability of food and water, employment and wages. That wages of workers did not decline during this period and are likely to have increased modestly is testament to the unprecedented outcomes of the industrial growth. Indeed it was the availability of jobs that led to masses of labourers migrating to the growing towns and cities in the first four decades of the 19th century and it was this historic migration of the population from the countryside to the city that caused much of the deprivation associated with the industrial revolution.   
       
    Such a huge migration was unplanned and unprecedented in the scope of English history. Inevitably the rapid urbanisation led to overcrowding, squalor and disease on a massive scale - it was this deprivation that Engels and Dickens witnessed. Dealing with this issue would be one of they challenges of the next 60 years.  
       
    Great Britain continued to make history by simultaneously growing and urbanising its population whilst establishing the world’s first industrial economy during the middle of the 19th century. The congregation of the working poor in great urban centres meant that the squalor and deprivation they suffered was visible and widely reported. Gradually liberal politicians introduced measures and reforms aimed at establishing some measure of protection and support for the labouring masses.  
       
    London established the world’s first civic police force in1829 to enforce law and order in the burgeoning metropolis. Parliament reacted to the establishment of hundreds of new industrial towns across the country by reforming local Government legislation and passing the Public Health Act 1848; placing the responsibility for a borough’s water, sewerage, drainage, paving, and environmental health regulation under a single local body. The Act set out a framework for organising the organisation of densely populated towns that had been established over a period of a few dozen years so that provision of sewerage, water and other utilities surpassed the standards previously set by Ancient Rome. In 1855 the Metropolis Management Act was passed by parliament which established the Metropolitan Board of Works to manage London’s infrastructure so that it could cope with the rapid expansion in population.

    Parliament did  not only establish frameworks for the supply of housing and utilities to the new urban workers, it also began to codify minimum standards by which workers must be treated. Throughout the 1830s a series of parliamentary acts regulating the hours that could be worked by adults, limited to 10 hours a day by 1847. Further laws were passed to protect women and children who were employed to carry out dangerous jobs in mines and factories.  
       
    Despite the establishment of a framework for managing the establishment of hastily established townships, disease still claimed a high mortality rate in urban Victorian England. London, with a population that had reached 1.5 million by 1830, was particularly susceptible to epidemics of infectious disease such as cholera and typhus. In the summer of 1854 a serious outbreak of cholera occurred in the London district of Soho, a local physician named Jon Snow (1813-1858) plotted the incidences of cholera using a dot map to infer that cholera was transmitted through infected water. In so doing Snow founded the science of Epidemiology, the study of the patterns, causes and effects of disease and the foundation of the modern policy of public health.   
       
    By 1851 the Industrial Revolution had fully matured and London was the largest metropolis the world had ever seen. Fittingly the city hosted the Great Exhibition, an exposition of British industrial hegemony. At that time Britain owned half the world’s ocean going ships and contained half of the world’s rail track. It’s steam engines produced more horsepower than half of Europe put together and its iron production was five times greater than than of America and ten times greater than that of Germany, which were its two nearest global rivals.   
       
    However, the 1850s were to mark the peak of Britain’s industrial dominance of the world. Already, other Western nation states were beginning a rapid period of industrialisation. The coalfields of Belgium, the Ruhr and Northern France provided fuel for factories which began to compete with Britain for the export of cotton, iron and steel. Across the Atlantic the United States had developed a textile industry during the first half of the 18th century and was rapidly establishing a transport system based on steam trains and steam ships.   
       
    The United States also pioneered a manufacturing industry based on increased mechanisation of labour, for example the sewing machine, invented by Barthélemy Thimonnier (1793-1857), increased the productivity of the cloth manufacturing industry by a factor of five. Britain had set out a clear blueprint for creating an industrial society and by 1850, her rivals in the West were ready to adopt it. Britain’s role as the single dominant industrial power was at an end but she had given the world the industrial economy - nothing would be the same again.  
       
       
    Government for the People, By the People  
       
    The Industrial Revolution was a social revolution as much as it was economic. Millions of workers migrated from the countryside to crowded towns that sprung out of previously bucolic villages and hamlets in a matter of a few decades. The descendants of these migrants - the new salaried proletariat - had better access to education and employment than their rural cousins. They were also freer to organise themselves and lobby for more political rights. The dramatic emergence of industrial towns and cities provided Governments and central planning authorities with huge challenges and forced them into establishing authorities to organise he provision of utilities and basic services. This increase in the role of the state and the power of ordinary workers created huge pressures on the existing systems of Government in the West, which had been designed to Govern rural societies with scattered populations.  
       
    By the start of the 1860s the states of Western Europe and the United States dominated the world in terms of industrial output, commerce and scientific progress. The United States had, unlike France, maintained a rudimentary form of representative of democracy after it's revolution at the height of the 18th century Enlightenment. And yet, the great contradiction of that great Enlightenment project remained, the United States’ original sin: slavery.  
       
    The prevalence of slavery across the United States had reduced since the country gained its independence, it was illegal in the industrialised northern states but remained deeply rooted in the southern plantation states. The booming cotton manufacturing industries of Western Europe meant that there was no economic incentive for the rural south to relinquish its highly profitable plantation system. The southern states consistently and vociferously opposed any attempts by the federal Government to abolish or even contain slavery. As new states were steadily added to the union, the question of whether they would allow or prohibit slavery became the key issue of the day.  
       
    Agitation against slavery continued to grow in the North and was given focus by the 1852 novel ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ written by Harriet Beecher-Stow (1811-1896). The novel told the story of the eponymous Tom, a black slave and preached a message of Christian love and brotherhood. In its first year it sold 300,000 copies in America and one million copies in Great Britain. The simmering tensions between an anti-slavery north and an increasingly secessionist south reached a tipping point with the election of Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) on an anti-slavery platform in 1860 precipitating the breakaway of the slaving southern Confederate states in early 1861.  
       
    Over the next five years Union and Confederate armies fought each other in a series of bloody battles marked by the use of industrially produced rifles, artillery and ironclad warships and which cost around one million casualties, around 3% of the population at the time. Despite the skill of Confederate generals and tenacity of their troops, the Union was always the likely victor, marshalling as it did almost the entire industrial output of the United States as well as the vast majority of its railroads.  
       
    In January 1865, in the dying days of the war, Congress ratified the 13th Amendment banning slavery in the United States.  A glaring deviation from the Enlightenment principles of the revolution, that all men are created equal, had at least nominally been exorcised. Yet the supposedly self-evident truth proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence would not be fully established in law for more than one hundred years. In the wake of the south’s defeat Southern blacks were left with little access to education or meaningful employment and were not defended from the discrimination of the defeated and often bitter and hateful Southern white society.   
       
    It would be decades before American women were allowed to vote and it would take even longer to overturn the racist and segregationist Jim Crow laws established by the defeated Southern states in the aftermath of the war. It would take the civil rights movements of the 1960s to finally overturn that searing injustice. As well as finally ending slavery in the Western world, the American Civil War also established that the United States would remain as a single continental power that would eventually emerge as the superpower, which from 1917 onwards would underwrite the security and freedom of the West.  
       
    Although Europe had eliminated slavery decades before America it lagged behind in the development of democratic, representative Government that exercised power with anything close to a legitimate mandate from its people. The great achievements of the French Revolution did not immediately result in liberal democracy. The military dictator Napoleon was finally defeated at Waterloo in 1815; the victorious European powers met at the Congress of Vienna with aim of ensuring that a continental war involving all of the major European powers did not break out again.   
       
    To a certain extent, the Congress was successful, no war on the scale of the Napoleonic Wars was fought again on European soil during the 19th century (despite numerous limited wars between rival European powers throughout the century) but this was likely more down to luck than the judgement of the attendees of the congress. The Congress did establish a basic framework for peace based on the concept of ‘balance of power’, but this peace was bought at the expense of the liberal impulses of the Enlightenment as conservative dynastic regimes were given priority over liberal democracy in the name of stability.  
       
    As literacy and education became more widespread and transport and communication became easier and cheaper, people began to identify more and more along the lines of culture, language and race. In 1848 a series of popular revolutions occurred across Europe which were loosely based on a combination of liberalism and nationalism. The revolutions were all ultimately failures but European history but nationalism, liberalism and socialism had replaced dynastic politics as the key ideas in European international relations.  
       
    The contours of the map of modern European nation-states slowly began to emerge following the failed revolutions of 1848, with Italy emerging as a more or less unified state in the 1860s. The new Italian state was not borne out of the liberal ideals espoused by previous revolutionaries, however. Increasingly nationalist movements needed to create alliances with conservative military forces, royal dynasties and engage in the power games being played by established continental powers.  
       
    The unification of Germany in 1871 epitomised the transformation of nationalism into a conservative militaristic force. In 1815 the German speaking people of Central Europe belonged to a patchwork of kingdoms, cities and territories that had formerly made up the Holy Roman Empire. A sense of German national belonging based on culture, language and race increased during the nineteenth century as communications across the territory rapidly improved. The Germanic states were dominated by the conservative and militarily powerful Kingdom of Prussia which aimed to consolidate its leadership of any future German state.   
       
    In 1861 Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) was appointed Chancellor of Prussia and under his leadership Prussia was able to forge a unified German state within 10 years. Bismarck understood the role that war could have in forging a common nationalist identity and Prussia developed a professional, technologically advance army which decisively defeated Austria, its main rival for leadership of the German peoples, in 1866. In 1870 France, threatened by the rising power of Prussia, was manoeuvred by Bismarck into making an ill-advised declaration of war against the German state in order to re-establish its own power.   
       
    The French were decisively defeated by a Prussian army that was delivered promptly to the battlefield by a highly-efficient German rail network and which made use of the latest in military technology including bolt-action rifles and precision artillery. Bismarck was able to use the war to portray Prussia as the defender of German rights and values and Germany was formally unified under Prussian leadership following France’s surrender in 1871.   
       
    For France the shock of military defeat triggered the fall of the monarch of the Third Republic and the establishment of a liberal democratic state. The foundation of Germany conversely was inextricably linked with a military legend of glorious victory. The new country, perhaps the most powerful in Europe, was run by an autocratic Prussian monarchy which was itself influenced by Prussian militarism. The creation of Germany by militaristic nationalists rather than democratic liberals would have grave consequences for Europe in the 20th century and would threaten the very future of the West as a culture of liberalism, freedom and democracy.  
       
    Isolated from the warfare and revolutions on the European continent during the first half of the 19th century, Britain had enjoyed increasing economic growth . As the Industrial Revolution gathered pace thousands of workers left the countryside for the promise of regular paid work in the country’s mushrooming industrial towns and cities   
       
    The huge increases in the sizes of towns such as Liverpool and Manchester in the early 19th century had the effect of exposing the corruption and inconsistencies of the unreformed House of Commons whereby a tiny hamlet such as Gatton in Surrey with just seven inhabitants could return more MPs than the whole of Manchester. Although Britain had long held the rule of law, equality under law and personal liberty as sacred, very few men were able to participate in the country’s rudimentary form of representative Government.  
       
    Representation in the Houses of Parliament had traditionally been based on the ownership of property which had been the traditional basis of power in pre-industrial societies. From the middle of the 18th century through to the 1820s the nascent industrial revolution mean that power increasingly came to be held by middle class industrialists, businessmen and merchants who were denied political representation under the existing system.  There was also a radical working-class campaign which suffrage for all males although at this time although most campaigners of the time were sceptical of universal suffrage as a result of the chaos and bloodshed of the French Revolution.  
       
    After a series of incremental reforms during the 1820s the Whig party came to power with an overwhelming popular mandate from the burgeoning middle classes and in 1832  it passed the Great Reform Act. The Act actually only increased the number of enfranchised males for 500,000 to 750,000 but nevertheless struck a decisive blow against the aristocracy’s grip on political power and established the principle of parliament representing the people rather than the self-interest of the aristocracy.   
       
    A second Reform Act in 1867 doubled the number of enfranchised men from one to two million and in 1872 the introduction of the secret ballot helped prevent any remnants of the open bribery and intimidation that had characterised 18th century elections. The fact that there was now a reasonably large electorate which needed to be courted necessitated the creation of organised political parties, and the Liberals and Conservatives moved to fill that gap during the Victorian era. Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (1804-1881) was quick to adapt to the new politics by championing ‘one nation Conservatism’ as a method of improving conditions for working classes and outmanoeuvring the Liberals - legislation covering public health and workers’ rights were key pieces of reform under his premiership.   
       
    By the end of 19th century Britain, without any formal planning, or written constitution had managed to balance revolutionary economic growth, a booming population and the creation of a massive urban proletariat whilst at the same time evolving, in a haphazard manner, a relatively democratic form of representative Government that exercised power via a credible popular mandate. The British parliamentary system of Government was so successful that it would also be successfully exported to Australia, Canada and New Zealand and in 1947 India, which remains the world’s most populous democracy.  
       
    The emergence of parliamentary democracy with a popular mandate was not pre-destined and may have been an accident of history, but it must owe something to the long years of peace on the British mainland, the spread of education and literacy amongst ordinary people, the earlier curtailment of the monarch’s powers and the strong British tradition of the rule of law, independent of the state.  
       
    By the end of the 19th century the United States, Britain and France had established robust, if imperfect, democratic systems of Government. Germany, the newly unified military and industrial powerhouse that sat astride central Europe had a parliament but had not developed the critical institutions of democracy. The German was still ruled, in theory, by an absolutist monarch. The failure to reform the relationship between a modern industrial military state and its pre-Enlightenment framework of Government would have fatal consequences for Europe, and the rest of the world.  
       
       
       
       
    Empires and Imperialism  
       
       
    On the night of 22 October 1707 a fleet of ships from the Royal Navy entered the English Channel on their way to their home port of Portsmouth. After a voyage from Gibraltar dominated by fierce storms the crews of the ships must have been relieved to be on the home stretch of their journey. Unbeknownst to the the fleet’s navigators, however, the ships and their crews were many miles north of where they believed themselves to be; four of the warships struck reef off the Isle of Scilly and sank with the loss of over 1500 lives.    
       
    An inability to establish longitude on long sea voyages had plagued mariners for centuries and had played a part in innumerable shipwrecks, the disaster off the Isles of Scilly was notable only for the size of the death toll. Humiliated by such a disaster in its home waters the Royal Navy set up a board of Longitude in 1714 which offered substantial financial rewards to anyone who could solve the problem of measuring longitude at sea.  
       
    In 1761 an English clockmaker John Harrison (1693–1776) won the competition when he invented the marine chronometer: a device which kept the time accurately on a pitching, rolling ship at sea. This allowed navigators to obtain accurate readings of their time both locally and at their home port, and allowed them to calculate accurately the longitudinal position of their ship. The invention of the marine chronometer greatly increased the safety of long distance sea travel and allowed Western states to strengthen their grip on long distance trade routes. Captain James Cook (1728-1779) of the Royal Navy mapped the eastern coast of Australia, circumnavigated New Zealand and made the first European contact with the Hawaiian islands during a series of expeditions in the 1770s. Cook’s expeditions were just the most prominent of the hundreds of voyages of scientific and geographic discovery that took place during the late eighteenth and early 19th centuries as Europeans explored, surveyed and mapped the Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. By the end of the 18th century, European command of the high seas was absolute.  
       
    In the early 1700s European imperial rule outside of the Americas mainly consisted of fortified trading ports and a few coastal territories in Asia. By this point it was already clear that no African or Asian power could contest European navies and even on land, European armies possessed overwhelming firepower, and technically superior vessels. 18th century European powers began to jostle amongst themselves to establish territorial claims in Asia, and India in particular. Inevitably war broke out between the two pre-eminent powers of the 18th century, Britain and France, although the Seven Years War of 1756-1763 drew in every major power and was the first war to be fought on five continents.The war was ended in Britain’s favour and it emerged as the sole power in North America, Australasia and India. However, the most telling aspect of the war was that the European powers divided up global possessions between themselves and can be seen as the start of the formal system of European global empire.  
       
    With explicit approval from the British Government the East India Company, annexed large parts of the Indian sub-continent during the early 19th century until it controlled virtually the whole sub-continent. In 1839 the Company forced importation of opium to Qing dynasty China provoked the First Opium War between Britain and the Chinese. The war was a disaster for the Chinese which lost up to 20,000 killed against around 300 British deaths. In the second Battle of Chuenpi in 1841 a fleet of armoured British steamships sank a 15 Chinese warships without incurring a single fatality. Such had been the pace of change over the previous 300 years that the once all powerful Chinese Empire was humiliated in its home waters by a small naval task force fighting thousands of miles from home.  
       
    The European powers used their new military power to enforce unfair commercial treaties and trading rights on African and Asian kingdoms while their fortified port settlements gradually evolved into colonial territories. After a mass rebellion by Indian against rule by the East India Company in 1857, the British brutally suppressed the rebellion and established formal rule over the entire sub-continent.The scene was set for further land grabs by all the European powers from Denmark to France. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the establishment of an uneasy peace amongst the European powers, France began to look to Africa to further its desire for imperial glory -  establishing a colony in Algeria in 1830. The African continent remained largely unexplored by Westerners until the 1870s when, with Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Italy established as advanced industrial powers, European Governments sought to expand their empires as a way of maintaining military power and prestige.   
       
    The so-called  ‘Scramble for Africa’ amongst European states meant that by 1914, five European powers had carved up almost the entire African continent between themselves. The absolute military and technological superiority of Europeans in Africa at the end of the century was underlined at the Battle of Omdurman in 1898, where the British colonial army defeated an Islamic uprising in Sudan. The maxim machine guns, artillery and bolt-action rifles rifles fielded by the British killed more than 10,000 Africans in one day, whilst the British colonial forces suffered fewer than 50 dead. The British and French Empires alone covered one third of the world’s land mass by 1914 and all the major European powers also enjoyed one-sided commercial agreements in China and other parts of Asia which were effectively enforced at the point of a gun.  
       
    Describing a the full impact of European colonisation between the 1850s and the end of the Second World War would require a separate book. Certainly the imperialism cannot in any way be described as benign: atrocities were carried out throughout the colonial period, with particularly barbaric acts taking lace in the Belgian Congo and German South West Africa. The British and French empires did bring some material benefits some of the territories they controlled, although the beneficial and the destructive effects of European empires are both likely overstated.   
       
    It is also doubtful that the empires contributed significantly or materially to the economic growth of Western states between 1850 and 1945 (America and Germany enjoyed the most impressive growth during this period with neither state possessing particularly large or prosperous overseas territories). However, what is not in doubt from a modern viewpoint is that imperialism was ethically and morally wrong, and that the West’s exploitation of its military and technological superiority was unacceptable and contrary to the values of the Enlightenment and what we now recognise as modern Western culture. Empires, however, remained generally popular with the European public and it would take the cataclysm events of the early 20th century before European states were amenable to withdrawing from their prized imperial possessions.  
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
    Forging the Modern World  
       
       
    In the mid-19th century scientists in Europe and the United States made a series of discoveries that would drive what became known as the Second Industrial Revolution. Also known as the Technological Revolution, this second phase of Western industrial development built on increasingly sophisticated science and technology.   
       
    Between the 1840s and 1914 Western scientific discoveries allowed human beings to capture and preserve images of time, harness electricity, record, play sounds, send and receive messages and sounds, communicate instantaneously over vast distances, produce vehicles that could propel themselves without horsepower, record and play moving images and produce machines that could fly through the sky. Other discoveries would shatter divinely held beliefs regarding the age of the earth and the creation of mankind and would begin to provide secular answers to questions about the nature of the universe.  
       
    Continuous improvement of industrial techniques continued apace during the 19th century. The manufacturing of iron and steel manufacturing, which had driven the early industrial revolution, continued to develop in efficiency. In 1856 Sir Henry Bessemer (1813 – 1898) described what became known as the Bessemer process which allowed industrialised countries to mass produce steel more cheaply than ever. Bessemer also pioneered a new technique for manufacturing glass in 1843, which allowed even ordinary workers’ homes to be fitted with relatively large windows.The very next year Sir Charles William Siemens (1823 – 1883) developed a steel manufacturing technique that was 70% more fuel efficient. Continued incremental improvements in the production of steel during the 19th century further brought down the costs of production and allowed the mass production machinery, ships, railroads and buildings.  
       
    But while the process of heavy manufacturing of metals and the mining of raw materials continued to be refined, the second half of the 19th century was marked by developments in the fields of electricity, chemicals and telecommunications. During a long career Michael Faraday (1791-1867) discovered the laws of electrolysis, invented the electric dynamo, the electromagnet (also independently invented by Joseph Henry (1797-1878)) and the Faraday Cage.  Faraday’s works and those of Andre Ampere (1775-1838), Georg Ohm (1789-1854) and others laid down the practical and theoretical basis that would allowed humans to harness the properties of electricity. In 1878 Joseph Swan (1828-1914) demonstrated a working electric light bulb; a year later Swan installed electric lighting on Mosley Street in Newcastle-upon-Tyne: the first street in the world to be electrically lit. At around the same time Thomas Edison had independently developed a different version of the electric light bulb and in 1882 he developed power stations in New York and London. Dozens of scientists and engineers in Europe and America made discoveries and breakthroughs that helped to develop the process of electrification. In 1891 Sebastian de Ferranti (1864 – 1930) built the world’s first modern power station in Deptford, south London. The high-voltage AC power lit factories and workshops and allowed the development of assembly lines and widespread electric street lighting. In 1886 Frank Julian Sprague (1857 -1934) developed DC current, allowing the development of electric street trams and further electrification of industry. In 1884 Sir Charles Parsons (1854-1931) invented the steam turbine which allowed even more efficient production of electricity and would allow the development of turbine-driven ships.  
       
    Whilst the harnessing of electricity facilitated continued expansion of manufacturing processes, new industries emerged throughout the 19th century. The Scottish chemist James Young (1811-1883) developed the world’s first oil refinery in 1848. In 1859 Edwin Drake (1819-1880) established the first ‘modern’ oil well in Pennsylvania, developed in part by adopting  cable tool drilling methods brought to the US by Chinese migrants. In 1856 the English chemist Sir William Henry Perkin (1838–1907) developed chemical dyes and in the forthcoming decades Germany would establish a world dominating chemicals having built on the works of Justus Freiherr von Liebig (1803 –1873) and August Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892). In 1910 German chemist Fritz Haber (1868-1934) and Carl Bosch invented the Haber-Bosch process, the method used to synthesise ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gases  in order to produce chemical fertiliser (upon which half of the world’s population still relies for their food supply). By the start of the 20th century the West not only led the world in total industrial output but was also creating new industries in the fields of plastics, petrochemicals, electronics, pharmaceuticals and biochemical medicine.  
       
    As well as developing a new type of industrial economy technological inventions and scientific discoveries began to have real impacts on society and people which could not be measured by increases in GDP. Charles Fenerty (1821-1892) and Friedrich Gottlob Keller (1816-1895) simultaneously and independently invented machines for extracting fibres from wood to make paper. In conjunction with steam-powered printing presses and the mass production of pencils and fountain pens, this allowed a further jump in the proliferation of fiction and non-fiction books, newspapers and magazines, and personal letters and diaries.  
       
    Letters and diaries were an ancient method of communicating across time and space but in the last thirty years of the 19th century technological inventions revolutionised human communications. In 1837 Rowland Hill (1795-1879), a low-ranking British civil servant, proposed a system of mail delivery that included a proof of payment in the form of a stamp, the ‘penny black’. By 1860 the number of letters sent per  person in Britain had risen to 19 per year, up from 3 per year in 1839. Communicating over long distances had become cheap, efficient and reliable. Communications became faster still with the development of the electoral telegraph by Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) and the creation of a working telegraph system by Samuel Morse (1791-1872). In 1866 the laying of a trans-Atlantic submarine cable allowed telegrams to be sent between London and New York, by 1876 near instantaneous telegram communication between London and New Zealand was possible. As people’s ability to communicate over long distances near instantaneously, their lives became managed by the measurement of time. The Waltham Watch Company pioneered the mass production of cheap pocket watches in America in the 1850s; over the next two decades the cost of timepieces plummeted so that they were available to ordinary workers. Very quickly the the measurement of time came to regulate every aspect of Western life: from work to leisure and organised sport.  
       
    In 1844 Charles Goodyear (1800-1860) and Thomas Hancock (1786-1865) simultaneously and independently discovered the process for the vulcanisation of rubber. In 1887 John Boyd Dunlop (1840-1921) invented the rubber pneumatic tyre which would enable the development of comfortable long-distance using personal transportation. Harry John Lawson (1852-1925) invented the bicycle in 1876, a product that to this day allows people to travel medium distances quickly, cheaply and cleanly. The  very same year the bicycle was superseded by a further quantum leap in the technology of travel when Niklaus Otto (1832-1891) perfected the internal combustion engine. Although it would be another decade before Gottlieb Daimler (1834-1900) and Wilhelm Maybach (1846-1929) invented the motorcycle and Karl Benz (1844-1929) invented the automobile. In the 1890s Herbert Akroyd-Stuart (1864-1927) and Rudolf Diesel (1858-1913) applied recent developments in thermodynamics to independently and simultaneously invent the diesel engine.  
       
    In 1875 Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) and Elisha Gray (1835-1901) independently and simultaneously invented the telephone - an invention that could barley have been imagined just a generation previously. Thomas Edison patented a phonograph that could record and playback sound in 1880. Guigliermo Marconi (1874-1937) built on the work of James Maxwell (1839-1871) and others  on thermodynamics and demonstrated the transition of wireless signals.   
       
    As the 19th century bled into the 20th, two bicycle technicians in rural Ohio were busy working on a plan to conquer one of the few remaining unconquered frontiers. Orville (1871-1948) and Wilbur (1867-1912) Wright spent years of completing painstaking research and trial and error development before developing the first powered aircraft in 1903. Human beings must surely dreamt of flying like birds for millennia; now that dream was a reality.    
       
    Not only could humans now conquer gravity and fly through the sky but they could also film themselves doing it. In 1826 Nicéphore Niépce (1765-1833) had produced the world’s first photograph and his partner Louis Daguerre (1787-1851) refined the photographic process by developing the Daguerreotype method of developing photographs onto metal plates - which allowed the first photographs of human beings to be taken.   
       
    British inventor William Fox Talbot (1800-1877) had invented a method of developing photographs onto paper in 1834 but only published this method after reading about the Daguerrotype in 1839. Fox Talbot’s photographic method allowed the development of multiple paper copies from a single photographic negative; a method that formed the basis of photography through to the advent of digital photography in the 21st century. Photography soon became popular as a mass medium and in 1854 photographs of the Crimean War were carried in British newspapers - transporting the reality of the war into the living rooms of British households. In 1884 George Eastman (1854-1932) invented roll film allowing ordinary people to take picture using his Kodak personal camera.  
       
    Roll film also made possible motion picture film a concept that was developed my dozens of engineers, inventors and scientists. Wordsworth Donisthorpe (1847-1914) invented the first motion camera in 1876 and in 1888 Louis Le Prince (1841-1891) invented a new design of motion camera that could utilise roll film. Numerous other pioneers such as William Edward Green (1855-1921), William Kennedy Dickson (1860-1935) and August (1862-1954) and Louis (1864-1948) Lumiere further developed motion cameras and roll film and meant that ‘moving pictures’ became a practical reality by the 1890s.   
       
    The last three decades of the century witnessed the invention of the bicycle, the telephone, the automobile, the phonograph, the radio and the aeroplane: inventions that were truly revolutionary for mankind and which are mostly still central to modern society today. Whilst the first Industrial Revolution represented a break from agricultural economy that had marked human history, the technological and scientific developments of the second industrial revolution created the modern world which we today take for granted.   
       
    This period of high technological innovation also witnessed the birth of the modern corporation or company as we would recognise it today and the rise of office workers. In 1874 Rasmus Malling-Hansen (1835-1890) patented the first commercially successful typewriter which would allow the logging and dissemination of the vast amounts of information that was required to run these complicated new corporations.  
       
    The second half of the 19th century witnessed the birth of many inventions that we still rely on today but it also fostered the rise of the Western world view. Specifically what may be characterised across as the beginning of a scientific explanation of the world that began the slow process of overturning centuries of religious dogma and is the starting point for the religiously sceptical societies of Western Europe and parts of North America.  
       
    In 1859 the English naturalist and geologist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was working on idea that he had first formed twenty years previously: a theory setting out a process he named natural selection which explained how animals had developed into their modern states without any reference to the role of a supernatural creator. Whilst completing this theory Darwin received a letter from an acquaintance who was working in Malaya, Alfred Russell Wallace (1823-1913), which described the same theory. Fearful of losing recognition for this great insight Darwin rushed to complete his work and published ‘On the Origin of Species’ in 1859.  Seven years after the publication of Darwin’s great work, Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) published the first work describing the concept of genetics.  
       
    Almost immediately the book provoked widespread debate and interest across the Western world, with wide ranging implications for scientific, social and religious ideologies which are still being played out today. By the 1870s the theory of evolution has it became known had been widely, but not universally, accepted in western scientific circles (Gregor Mendel’s work would not be widely accepted until 1900).   
       
    Although Europeans and Americans remained religious by modern standards, scientists were not only providing secular answers to questions on the nature of the universe but providing answers that left the existence of God, as described in the bible, open to doubt. In 1830 Charles Lyell (1797-1875) published the Principles of Geology, which suggested that the earth’s features had been created by natural events rather than divine design as suggested by the bible. The subsequent development of geology and palaeontology as serious sciences during the nineteenth century and the gradual acceptance of Darwin’s theories, essentially meant that it was no longer possible for serious thinkers to accept the proposition, seemingly so sure in 1800, that the bible was literally true.  
       
    In other fields of science key discoveries continued at pace throughout the 19th century. Robert Brown (1773-1858) discovered Brownian Motion in 1827, Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis (1792-1843) discovered the Coriolis Effect in 1835, (Christian Doppler (1803-1853) described the Doppler Effect in 1842, William Thomson (1824-1907) proposed the First Law of Thermodynamics in 1850,  Leon Foucault (1819-1868) demonstrated the earth’s rotation in 1851. James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879) formulated the theory of electromagnetic radiation in 1873 which predicted the light represented a transmission of energy in wave form, a theory which was verified by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894) in 1888 and allowed the development of the radio by Guigliermo Marconi.  
       
    In 1895 Wilhelm Rontgen (1845-1923) caused a scientific sensation when he announced the discovery of x-rays and a year later Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered the certain kinds of matter emit radiation. In 1897 J.J. Thomson (1856-1940) discovered the electron and Marie (1867-1934) and Pierre (1859-1906) Curie discovered uranium, radium and plutonium. In 1909 Hans Geiger (1882-1945) and Ernest Marsdean (1889-1970) discovered the atomic nucleus and in 1911 Ernest Rutherford (1871-1931) produced a model of the atom.  
       
    The fifty years between 1850 and 1900 witnessed scientific discoveries that were easily the equal to those of the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and17th centuries and without which the modern world as we know it simply would not exist. And yet, just a few years later, a 26 year old patent office clerk from Switzerland would produce a theory seemingly out of nowhere which remains one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time. Albert Einstein (1879-1855) published the General Theory of Relativity in 1905. In simple terms the theory of relativity represents the observation that measurements of time and space are affected by motion between an observer and what is being observed - in reality Einstein’s theory represented and insight into the nature of the universe which not replace religious explanations of the nature of the universe - it provided answers to questions that religion had not even dreamt to ask.  
       
    The period from 1870 to 1914 also saw the greatest sustained economic growth in human history. Unlike the first Industrial Revolution the living standards of ordinary workers improved dramatically thanks to improvements in technology. Northern European and North American cities continued to establish improvements in the quality of utilities and services available to their fast increasing populations. Such improvements included sewerage systems, piped drinking water fed by reservoirs, flushing toilets and streets lit by electricity. London, for example, had 13,000 miles of sewers by 1875 - part of a network designed by Joseph Bazalgette (1819-1891) which is still in use today. So successful was Britain in meeting the challenge of building working, large-scale cities that provided shared utilities, that by 1890 more than 90% of the population was urbanised (a ratio not achieved in America and continental Europe until after the Second World War). However, the United States was quick to take a lead role in ensuring an improving quality of life for city dwellers, particularly those in climates less favourable than temperate Britain. In Willis Carrier (1875-1950) invented air conditioning in 1902, a technology that would improve the quality of life for millions in the Southern United States and subsequently across Africa, Asia and South America. In 1908 American doctor John Leal (1858-1914) pioneered the technique of chlorination of the supply of water to render it safe for drinking: a development that has saved countless millions of lives  
       
    In the second half of the 19th century Western countries were increasingly  able to rise to the challenges posed to public health by rapid urbanisation by ensuring cities were able to provide essential utilities such as safe drinking water, sewerage, transport, and electricity. At the same time the field of modern, evidence-based medicine began to be firmly established in the west. For centuries the single biggest killer of patients who underwent rudimentary surgery or other medical interventions was infection. And for centuries few medical practitioners were able to establish evidence based theories for what caused fatal infections. That it might be doctors’ unwashed hands or surgical instruments that caused the the death of millions of unfortunate patients was an anathema to the medical profession.  
       
    One of the simplest but most important observations in the field of medicine was the insight gained in 1847 by Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (1818-1865) that patient mortality could be drastically cut if doctors washed their hands. Opposition to this idea by doctors was not substantially overcome, however, until Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) put forward a scientific basis for germ theory and together with Robert Koch (1843-1910) and Ferdinand Cohn (1828-1898) founded the field of microbiology. Koch alone was responsible for identifying the bacterium that caused blood poisoning and tuberculosis, together two of the biggest killers in human history.  
       
    The simple act sterilising hands and instruments which was subsequently widely adopted by Western medical practitioners has saved countless millions of lives. Joseph Lister (1827-1912) further developed the practice of infection control and prevention by introducing the concept of antisepsis into surgery. As well as death by infection - excruciating pain for patients had been a feature of medicine for centuries.  Attempts at rudimentary anaesthesia for operations had not progressed much beyond hard alcohol before James Young Simpson (1811–1870) administered the first general anaesthetic in the form of chloroform to a patient in 1847.   
       
    Surgeons were now able to carry out longer and more complex surgeries and surgical techniques continued to evolve through the the 19th century with William Stewart Halstead (1852–1922) establishing modern surgical principles (as well as introducing the latex glove). Hospitals too were run on increasingly professional lines as the 19th century unfolded. Florence Nightingale (1822-1910) established the first training school for hospital nurses in 1860 and as medicine grew increasingly sophisticated hospitals began to develop more specialised departments. Hospitals were established across hundreds of towns and cities across Europe during the 19th century and, although these were often still funded by religious orders, hospitals increasingly came to by funded by public subscription. Pharmacies also began to sell the first cheap modern drugs such as aspirin and Salvarsan, rather than traditional herbal remedies. Mental health had long been a malady that had been ignored, misunderstood or punished, now medicine began to treat it as with an other illness. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) founded a new branch of medicine, psychoanalysis, in an attempt to address the detriment suffered by millions who endured mental ill-health.  
       
    Despite the health risks caused by rapid urbanisation, average life expectancy at birth in Western Europe rose from 30 to 50 over the course of the 19th century. By the eve of the First World War an industrial worker in Western Europe might expect to have a life expectancy two or three times that of his medieval forbearers (and of contemporary citizens in pre-industrial states).  
       
    Ordinary men and women were still poor by today’s standards  but by the standards of human history they were the first example of ordinary people to have access to regular salaried employment, access to a wide range of material goods, decent accommodation and regular, if not generous, leisure time. It was during this time that the sports of football, rugby, cricket, tennis, badminton, baseball, American Football and basketball were codified. Working class communities in England established football and rugby leagues with the English Football League being established in 1888. Industrialised working classes also began to gain access to the first secular holidays - with workers in English mill towns being allowed week-long holidays to the seaside provided they worked double shifts the weeks before and after. The Education Act passed in Britain in 1870 established a nationwide system for the provision of elementary education to children. By 1900 literacy rates in Britain were 97.5% and 97.1% for men and women respectively.  
       
    Working class culture also extended to music both in organised bands and orchestrated and of the more bawdy musical variety as well as theatre and plays and, by the turn of the century, the cinema. Newspapers and magazines which had first emerged as a form of media in the 17th century continued to grow in terms of the numbers and scope of publications and their readership, which extended to the working classes. The literary novel too had become a form of mass culture as well as art with authors such as Victor Hugo (1802-1885), Charles Darwin (1812-1870), Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) and Mark Twain (1835-1910) establishing the novel as a fundamental part of Western culture.  
       
    By the 19th century art as a didactic tool, for entertainment and for its own sake, was firmly established as an element of culture and numerous public and commercial art galleries were established during the century. Western art displayed a trend towards realism in the late nineteenth century and a move towards modern art. Claude Monet  (1840-1926), Edgar Dagas (1834-1917), Eduard Manet (1832-1883) and Pierre-August Renoir (1841-1919) pioneered the Impressionist movement which was further developed by Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890), Paul Cezanne (1839-1906) and Paul Gaugin (1848-1903) whose paintings placed an emphasis on abstraction and symbolism. These post-impressionist paintings in turn served as a basis for a move towards abstract art pioneered by Henri Matisse (1869-1954), Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) from which emerged the movements named cubism, expressionism, surrealism. Collectively these movements made up modern art and influenced all aspects of visual arts including photography, design and architecture. Just as Western economies came to be dominated by machines, factories and new technologies Western art reflected the journey society had taken towards a modern and futuristic new world.  
       
    By the end of the 19th century the West’s domination of world economic output was absolute: Europe and America represented more than 80% of world economic output by 1900. Improvements in rail and sea transport meant that grain and meat could imported by Western European states from the Americas, Australasia and Eastern Europe at cheaper and cheaper rates. At the same time some sixty million Europeans emigrated to meet the demand for workers in America, South America and the British ‘seedling’ states of Australia, New Zealand and Canada which were organised along British legal, political and economic lines.  
       
    The opportunities of immigration acted as a pressure valve against growing popular discontent as populations boomed across Europe, but an increasingly urbanised, salaried and educated population momentum for increase political rights began to grow across industrialised western states. A political movement known as socialism emerged as Western Europe urbanised and industrialised which was based on the pro-revolutionary ideas of Karl Marx (1818-1883) who argued that the capitalist industrial revolution was the staging post on the road to the creation of a workers’ utopia.  
       
    Dissatisfaction with the capitalist economy and the rights available to working people continued to grow but the mass revolution predicted by Marx did occur. Although life could still be very harsh and most people were still poor by modern standards, capitalism had been able deliver material improvements in material prosperity for workers, in spite of the enormous European population boom.   
       
    Socialists in the more prosperous Western states of Britain, America and France began to drift towards political parties as a means of improving the lot of workers. Trade Unions had agitated for workers’ rights throughout the 19th century and in 1900 the Labour Party was founded in the UK to lobby for the rights of workers in parliament.  
       
    By 1914 most Western states had universal male suffrage, or something close to it. Increasingly Western Governments recognised the needs to provide more for an urbanised proletariat which had received elementary education and had the ability to organise political representation. In the 1880s Chancellor Bismarck, political leader of the newly united Kingdom of Germany introduced rudimentary old age pensions, accident insurance, medical care, and unemployment insurance which would form the basis of the 20th century modern European welfare state. Britain and other Western countries also began to introduce basic old age pensions and unemployment insurance at the start of the 20th century.   
       
    The increasing role of the state as a provider of basic services for the working classes was not enough to meet the demands of the brave new world that rapid industrialisation had created. Women, were an increasing visible and powerful force in societies that had been patriarchal for as long as history could be traced.   
       
    In the last decades of the 19th century dozens of jobs in factories, offices and shops had become available to women who were an increasingly important part of the economy.  The establishment of gas, electricity and water supplies, the provision of cheap processed food and the manufacture of soaps and detergents helped to free women from their traditional role of domestic servitude. Girls were increasingly able to access the same level of education as men, at first at an elementary level and during the 1870s universities began to admit female students; by 1914 16% of British undergraduates were female.   
       
    Access to salaried employment women allowed women to form their own trade unions and campaign for better conditions, just as working men had done a generation earlier. Inevitably demands for equal economic rights led to demands for equal political rights and campaigns for female suffrage were vociferous by the early twentieth century although only Finland, Norway, New Zealand and parts of America and Australia granted female suffrage before the cataclysm of the First World War.  
       
    By 1914 something that we can began to recognise as modern Western culture had begun to crystallise. The fields of modern science and medicine had essentially been established over the course of the 19th century, as had an economy based on industry and technology accompanied by sophisticated finance. In the previous 70 years many of the key products of our modern world were invented, the camera, the telephone, the car, the radio, the aeroplane all appeared within the space of a couple of generations.  
       
    Workers, while not rich by today’s standards, nevertheless on the whole enjoyed regular salaried work, decent accommodation with the provision modern utilities, the beginnings of a welfare state and access to leisure time, and increasingly cheap material goods. Britain, America and France were liberal, if deeply imperfect democracies, and conservative forces in the ruling classes were fighting what appeared to be a rearguard action against the drift towards universal suffrage.  Christianity’s role had been relegated from being powerful political force that controlled every aspect of people’s lives to a more benign, spiritual movement. Its scriptures - although still widely followed - were no longer seen as representing the literal truth.   
       
    To a historian in 1914 reviewing the past 400 years of history it must have seemed that the Western world, so far in advance of the rest of the globe, was on an unstoppable trajectory of progress in terms of material goods, economic wealth, culture, scientific knowledge and political liberalism. And perhaps, that’s how it might have stayed had the chauffeur of a car carrying a member of a central European royal family taken a wrong term and driven straight towards a terminally-ill, hapless assassin named Gavrilio Princip.  
       
    Cataclysm: Europe Goes to War  
       
       
    European society in 1914 was the product of a century of unparalleled progress in science, technology and commerce. Britain and France, two of the continents leading powers, had elements of what we recognised today as the modern, democratic, liberal nation states. Yet other European states had not undergone the same level of political development. Germany - unified only in 1871 - possessed one of the world’s most sophisticated and wealthy industrial economies but it lagged behind Britain and France on the journey towards democratic Government.  
       
    Despite having an elected parliament, its Kaiser still held the same absolute power as that enjoyed by a late medieval monarch. Germany’s political system was more suited to Governing a feudal pre-industrial society than Europe’s most industrially advanced country. Too much power was vested in an unstable and unsuitable king and its foreign policy was geared towards achieving military glory and gaining international respect, rather than peaceful prosperity and diplomatic compromise.   
       
    Similarly the moribund Austro-Hungarian Empire was run by an autocratic, anachronistic royal family which measured national success by the amount of land it could annex. If Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1863-1914) had not met his death on a June day in Sarajevo than the popular pressures exerted by a newly industrialised economy may have allowed a peaceful transfer of power to parliamentary democracy and Europe may never have known how close it was to armageddon.   
       
    But on 28 June 1914, against better advice, Franz Ferdinand began a tour of Sarajevo in the restive Austro-Hungarian possession of Bosnia. After narrowly avoiding one assassination attempt earlier in the day, the arch-duke and his wife were returning home when his driver took a wrong turn and blundered into the Serbian nationalist assassin Gavrila Princip, who seized the unexpected opportunity to murder the royal couple and took his unwanted place in world history.   
       
    Once the assassination had occurred a web of Central European alliances triggered an unstoppable march towards continental war - a war that the leaders of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany lacked the wit, sophistication or will to avert. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand tipped an industrialised Europe into a war with medieval objectives, orchestrated by a few absolute monarchs who represented a hangover from the pre-enlightenment era.  Millions of men would die because Kaiser Wilhelm II, Tsar Nicholas and Emperor Franz Josef valued the conquest of land they had surveyed on a map ahead of human life and civilised society.  
       
    It had been a century since the last major war involving France, Britain and Germany. In that 100 years the same culture of applied science, mass-manufacturing and technological innovation that had created cars, planes and telephones had also created magazine fed rifles, machine guns, high explosive, howitzers, mortars, torpedoes and chemical weapons. Europe applied its industrial brilliance to the execution of war and between 1914 and 1918 Britain, France and Germany excelled at the mass-manufacture the death of millions of their own citizens.   
       
    The First World War was the world’s first industrial war. Men were transported to the frontline by steam trains, turbine powered warships and motorised buses. Millions of troops were supplied with food, water, munitions and post supplied from across the world and distributed via a vast logistics network utilising thousands of miles of railways. Heavily armoured, turbine powered warships duelled in the North Sea, submarines stalked the merchant ships which brought goods to Europe’s shores from across the world, fleets of aeroplanes fought for supremacy of the skies, Zeppelins bombed civilians in their own homes and tanks replaced cavalry as the decisive weapon on the battlefield.  
       
    Few Europeans in August 1914 could have anticipated the magnitude of the slaughter that would take place over the next four years; but the reality of industrial warfare all too quickly became apparent. France suffered well over half a million casualties before the end of 1914. In earlier wars, such casualty rates would have settled the matter, but the industrial capacity that created such slaughter also allowed the allied armies to reorganise, establish defences, equip and feed their armies and conscript and transport millions of new recruits to the battlefields. The British Army alone required 20,000 tonnes of supplies per day to function effectively; these supplies were drawn from all over the world, stockpiled at huge depots in Northern France and transported to the front along 2,000 miles of specially built railway tracks.   
       
    The armies of France and Germany, each millions of men strong, were also kept supplied in the field by similarly complex and vast logistical enterprises as the war on the Western Front became bogged down in bloody stalemate. Single battles now lasted longer and claimed more lives than entire was had done previously. In 1916 alone the Battle of Verdun claimed a million lives; the Battle of the Somme consumed a million more before the year was out.  
       
    The scale of the war drained every resource available to the major European powers, the British and French armies were reinforced in the field by men from their empires’ colonies. Not only white Australians, New Zealanders South Africans and Canadians but also Senegalese, Algerians and Indians who fought and died on behalf of what they saw as their mother countries. The industries of the combatant states were given over entirely to the war effort and the state took unprecedented control over the economy, the press and many aspects of daily life. Even this was not enough to meet the unrelenting demands of full-scale industrial war. Britain liquidated its world wide investments and went from being the world’s leading creditor to a debtor nation, importing arms, food and raw materials from around the world. South American and Asian countries benefitted from this sudden demand from Europe but it was the United States which enjoyed a sustained economic boom as it supplied the allies with everything a modern war required from grain through to machines and weapons.  
       
    Both sides recognised that access to the global trading system was the key to winning the war and the Royal Navy enforced a crippling blockade on Germany throughout the conflict. The German navy was not strong to enough to break the blockade but it sought to use another modern weapon, the submarine, to sink the merchant ships bringing cargoes to Britain and break its lifeline to the rest of the world. The unrestricted warfare conducted by German submarines did not cause critical shortages for the British war effort but ultimately, the destruction of American shipping only precipitated the entry of the United States into the war on the side of the allies in March 1917.  
       
    The entry of the United States with its vast reserves of men, raw materials and industrial output effectively decided the outcome of the war. The German army attempted one last desperate offensive in March 1918 after the Bolshevik revolution knocked Russia out of the war but this too failed, at the cost of another 1.5 million casualties on all sides. Following the failure of the German 1918 Spring Offensive the allied armies counterattacked using recognisably modern tactics which combined tanks, aeroplanes, and sophisticated artillery barrages and drove the German army into full retreat for the first time in four years.   
       
    After four years of blockade and having suffered millions of casualties the will of the German people to endure the war began to buckle; a mutiny by the German navy developed into a series of nationwide protests which threatened to develop into a national revolution. On 9 November 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm, who had wielded almost absolute power in 1914 and held much of the blame for starting the war, was forced to abdicate. The same day the Social Democrat party declared a republic and requested an armistice with the allied powers.   
       
    The killing continued right up to the minute that the armistice took effect at 11am on 11 November 1918. After four years of warfare there was scarcely a family amongst the combatant countries that was left unaffected. The battles that occurred between 1914 and 1919 left more than 10 million combatants dead and millions more wounded, France and German combatant fatalities represented around 4% of their respective populations.   
       
    The European combatant nations had conscripted all able bodied males and the sacrifice demanded of an entire generation of all classes meant that any lingering opposition to universal male suffrage melted away. Whilst men had been conscripted into the armed services, women had stepped up to replace them in the key domestic industries had demonstrated that they were every bit the equals of the men who had left their jobs to fight. Female suffrage was enacted in Great Britain in 1918 although it would not be until 1945 that universal female suffrage was enshrined in law across the west.  
       
    European hegemony over the rest of the world which had been a matter of fact for the last 300 years had finally been broken. Aside from the immense loss of life, the economies of the European powers had been shattered with European manufacturing output in 1919 being 25% lower than it had been in 1914. Huge debts were owed to the nations that had kept them supplied with raw materials during the war, with the United States being the clear economic beneficiary from the conflict (despite itself losing 116,000 dead).   
       
    What is more, the French and British had sought to squeeze every available resource from their colonies, including the use of combat soldiers from Africa and Asia to replace their own dead. Having declared to the rest of the world that they were fighting the German Empire to defend liberty, democracy and freedom. Although the French and British would carve up the remnants of the German and Ottoman colonial empires between themselves under the guise of ‘mandates’ in reality the writing was on the wall for the days of European empire, even it would take a second and even more destructive world war, to hasten the European imperial end game.  
       
    The peace conference established at Versailles at the end of 1918 represented an attempt by the victorious powers to forge a modern world out of the ashes of conflict. In January 1918 US president Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924) set out his ‘fourteen points’, a manifesto for a post war world organised along the principles of democracy, self-determination and free trade and a body named the League of Nations to settle international disputes: some of the key values that we now consider to be inherent to Western civilisation. The conference was dominated by the victorious power, America, Britain and France, but was attended by numerous nations from outside Europe and the delegates attempted bravely, if naively, to establish a framework for peace, not just in Europe, but across the entire world.  
       
    To a certain extent these principles were put into practice when the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 - new democratic republics were established from the remnants of the old German and Austro-Hungarian empires and pacifism emerged as a much stronger force, particularly in Britain and France. However, such was the dislocation caused by the war that it spawned existential threats to the idea of a Western culture based on liberal democracy, free trade, internationalism and individual liberty. Nationalism remained a potent force and fascism and communism had emerged from the war as powerful ideologies offering citizens seductive alternatives to the nuanced benefits of liberal democracy.  
       
    Nevertheless the West in the 1920s looked to have recovered somewhat from the cataclysm of the Great War. The major Western states, including Germany, affirmed the desirability of liberal democracy and technological and scientific achievements took off from where they left off in 1914. Max Planck (1858-1947) and Niels Bohr (1885-1962) received Nobel Prizes in 1918 and 1922 respectively for their pre-war work on Quantum Mechanics, a field that even today sits at the cutting edge of physics. Further development of Quantum Mechanics was undertaken by Erwin Shroedinger (1887-1961) and Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976).  
       
    Technological developments continued to create new economies and transform society: the radio became commercially available in the early 1920s as did the refrigerator (patented by Nathaniel Wales 1883 -1974) vacuum cleaner (invented by Hubert Cecil Booth 1871-1955), and the washing machine (numerous developers). The television was invented independently and simultaneously by John Logie Bird (1888-1946) and Philo Farnsworth (1906-1971). Sophisticated mass manufacturing techniques pioneered by Henry Ford (1863-1947) allowed cars and electrical consumer goods to be produced more cheaply than ever, whilst consumer credit allowed ordinary men and women to purchase radios and even automobiles. Working class men and women could watch Hollywood film in palatial cinemas which, thanks to engineers such as George Groves (1901-1976), featured sound from 1927 onwards.  
       
    In 1920s America black families from the South began to take part in mass migration to the industrial cities of the north where the boom in factory jobs which started during the war continued unabated in the peace. Among the exodus of blacks from the rural south was Louis Armstrong (1901-1971), the grandson of slaves who would help to form and popularise jazz music, which quickly caught on with young middle class white Americans, and later Europeans.   
       
    Dance halls and clubs playing jazz and swing music became popular with young people who increasingly had disposable income to spend on entertainment. The Flapper - girls who supposedly wore daringly low cut dresses smoke and drank in public and engaged in sex outside marriage - emerged as one of the first examples of youth culture (and of the resulting moral panics by the establishment). Whether or not the stereotype of the Flapper was fair or representative, it was clear that something fundamental had changed. There was now a recognisable youth culture and it did not adhere to the restrictive morals of the victorian era (although sex outside marriage largely remained a taboo).   
       
    Women certainly benefitted from a loosening of the societal norms on dress codes, hemlines on dresses were raised to knee level for the first time in perhaps centuries. Women also took to wearing male clothes and the adoption of trousers as a form of practical female clothing occurred in the 1920s. Although female sexuality remained a controversial subject, it was less of a taboo then it had been and the voices of women in society began to be heard for the first time. In 1916 Margaret Sanger (1879-1966) opened a birth control clinic and together with Katherine McCormick (1875-1967) helped to organise lobbying which was successful in securing the legalisation of contraception in the United States. In the United Kingdom Marie Stopes’ (1880-1958) published Married Love in 1918, a book that contained powerful argument in favour of contraception and women’s rights and was an immediate runaway success.  
       
    The 1920s did not, however, represent the triumph of liberalism and liberty over the forces of prejudice and hatred. The decade witnessed the peak membership of the Ku Klux Klan with hundreds of blacks in America’s southern states being lynched every year. Reflecting popular prejudice against mass immigration, American legislators passed the 1924 Immigration Act restricting immigration from non anglo-saxon countries. Ominous political events were also occurring in Europe, where Italy had fallen under a new fascist government in 1923.   
       
    The global economic boom of the 1920s, whilst spurring the development of the modern economy based on consumer goods was based on precious foundations. The establishment of a communist regime in Russia had sealed off a large and growing market from Western exporters; Germany, once Europe’s economic dynamo was saddled with war reparations and the system of international capital exchanges routed through London’s financial markets had not recovered it’s pre-war sophistication or swagger.   
       
    The European economies had become dangerously reliant on the American post-war economic boom for growth; 1920s America produced 40% of the world’s coal and more than 50% of global manufactured goods. So reliant had Europe become on this new economic superpower that a cyclical downturn in America could crash the entire world economy.  
       
    In 1928 the American economy did begin to enter such a cyclical downturn which began to effect the overinflated stock market. The warning signs were ignored or mismanaged by American central bankers and politicians and in October 1929 the stock market dramatically collapsed after a decade of rampant growth. The responses of European and American Governments and central banks were cack-handed and served only to make matters worse: the world economy soon entered a death spiral. National incomes in the United States fell by 38% between 1929 and 1932; in both Europe and America it was the working and middle classes who suffered the most as the world collapsed into economic depression.   
       
    As the global depression deepened during the 1930s the liberalism that underpinned the Western world came under an existential threat from two very different ideas about how society should be organised. The economic system that had promised prosperity to the millions of ordinary workers who had served their country in the war had collapsed and democracy was under threat from anti-democratic extremists on left and right. Communism, a dogma in which workers were promised a utopia, was being pioneered in the Soviet Union. Meanwhile Italy, which like Russia had been shattered by the first world war, had embraced fascism: a new movement which saw aggressive nationalism, racial purity and military glory as the route to the utopia.  
       
    The established democracies of Britain, France and the United States were able to withstand internal pressure and prevent a lurch towards fascist or communist politics. The United States under the leadership of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945) embarked on an enormous fiscal spending programme to haul its way out of depression. It was in Germany, with its strongly traditional militaristic upper class and a nationalistic working class still bitter about the country’s defeat in World War One, that fascism found fallow ground following the Great Depression. In a country with a limited history of parliamentary democracy, the Nazi party led by Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) offered a simple and powerful response to the problems facing a nation still bitter about defeat in the First World War, devastated by the economic depression and deeply fearful of communist revolution.  
       
    With a mix of charismatic speeches, utilisation of the radio and the aeroplane for political campaigning - together with the support of a well organised and ruthless street movement -Hitler and the Nazi party won the largest share of the popular vote in the 1932 general elections.  Hitler was appointed chancellor in 1933 and quickly moved to seize total power. Nazi Germany fed off all the worst prejudices and fears of human beings to create a state in which religious, ethnic, political sexual minorities were brutally repressed. The party became the state, to which the individual was expected submit.  
       
    Germany an economic powerhouse with a well educated population, Germany a country with a long history of nurturing composers, painters, philosophers scientists and engineers, Germany a country at the geographic heart of Europe: this was the society produced a political regime from the darkest depths of humanity.   
       
    Many critics of the concept of Western Civilisation often often point to the sins of empire, slavery, world war, racism and fascism as evidence that they entire concept of a ‘Western Civilisation’ is a fallacy. But that is to misunderstand what Western Civilisation means. It wasn’t born fully formed; it’s a concept that represents a never-ending journey, a constant struggle towards a fairer society, free from ignorance, prejudice and want. Everything we take for granted was debated, argued over and fought for, from universal suffrage to economic liberalism, from freedom of religion to freedom of sexuality.  
       
    Often the values now considered inherent to Western Civilisation were only defined in opposition to another system of thought. For example the American Civil War between the anti-slavery unionists and the pro-slavery Confederates, and the Second World War, fought between the liberal democracies and the fascist Axis powers.  
       
    The liberal democracies did not choose a reckoning with the forces of fascism. At first they tried to ignore it, then accommodate it, and then bargain with it before they finally realised the game was up. Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, three days after it had invaded Poland. Twenty years after the armistice that ended the First World War, Europe was again plunged into conflict.  
       
    The Second World War was fought on a scale, with a ferocity, and on a scope, that eclipsed all previous wars. The war would witness the near extermination of European Jews, a genocide which was directly conducted by only a few thousands but which involved the direct and indirect conspiracy and acquiescence of hundreds of thousands of Europeans from politicians, businessmen, industrialists, police, civil servants, railway workers and civilians. It was a war which Britain would later misremember as having fought alone: despite enlisting the help of millions of African and Indian subjects as well as European allies.  
       
    In contrast to the largely static warfare of the First World War the Nazi regime won a series of swift victories against the Allied powers. By 1941 it controlled Europe from the Atlantic coast to the outskirts of Moscow. The future of the West as a collection of democratic states and liberal societies was in grave danger as the totalitarian regimes of Nazism and Soviet communism fought for mastery of the European continent. Only following the Japanese Empire’s ill-advised attack on Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941 did the triumph of a democratic, liberal West become probable.  
       
    Over the next four years Allied forces fought the Nazi regime from North Africa, through Italy and across northern Europe, before meeting the Soviet Empire on the banks of the Elbe River as the Nazi regime collapsed. The campaign on the Western front cost the lives of millions of combatants and civilians and destroyed entire areas of the European continent, tens of millions more people were made homeless and stateless in the cataclysm. At the war’s end Allied and Soviet soldiers began to liberate concentration camps in which tens of thousands of otherwise ordinary German and European citizens had perpetrated the near extermination of Jewish people on the European continent. Perhaps the worst single crime in human history, the Holocaust had combined ancient European racial prejudices with European industrial methods and modern technology.  
       
    In Nazism the West had spawned an evil regime that had virtually exterminated an entire race, created a totalitarian state that controlled the lives of its subjects and launched a war that convulsed Europe, killed tens of millions, left millions more homeless and starving and destroyed many of Europe’s greatest cities. Centuries of progress had brought Europe to a state of conflict and human misery that, through the power of modern industry and technology, was even greater than that of the Thirty Years War three hundred years earlier.   
       
    In 1945 Europe was a shattered, exhausted, homeless, starving continent; stunned by the enormity of what had recently passed: the violence, the destruction, the depravation of humanity. The old era of European hegemony and global empire that had existed since 1500 had gone forever; colonial wars of independence were already underway across Asia in 1945. From the ashes of 1945, and indeed in reaction to this apocalypse, Europe went on to create a new future for itself; a future where glory was not to be found in empire or nationalism, but in economic growth, scientific endeavour, peaceful co-operation and the welfare of its citizens  
       
    That is the future that we, the post-war generations, have inherited. Yet it remains a great warning from history that centuries of progress in education, technology, science, health and welfare did not prevent Europeans from falling prey to the basest human instincts of racial hatred, supremacism and violence in 1914, and again in 1939. The Nazi regime demonstrated how quickly ordinary people can be seduced by devils of human nature; it’s a situation that may still be so.  
       
    Brave New World  
       
       
    The Second World War was eventually ended by the dropping of two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; an appropriately terrible and cataclysmic end to a long and exceptionally bloody war. Whether or not Japan would have surrendered without the use of ‘the bomb’ is unknowable but the arguments for its use remain reasonable and legitimate, given the exceptional circumstances of the time.   
       
    The victory of the allies over Germany and Japan clearly owed immensely to the sacrifice made millions of young soldiers, (and in the case of the defeat of Germany the overwhelming majority of that sacrifice was made by the  soldiers of the Soviet Union). Notwithstanding the contribution made by countless millions of young men and women, the overwhelming technological and industrial superiority of the allies was another fundamental factor in the defeat of the axis powers.  
       
    The Manhattan Project which led to the development of the atomic bomb was the clearest manifestation of this technological superiority - it was reckoned to have cost as much as all the scientific research ever conducted since the start of recorded history up to that point. The project drew on the greatest achievements of western science, having been developed from the work of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and the other prominent physicists of the early twentieth century and was masterminded by scientists Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) and Robert J Oppenheimer (1904-1967). Despite the terrible implications of atomic weapons, the project, based on the crowning achievements of Western science, also offered a path to improving human society by creating the possibility of nuclear generated electricity. This potential was realised when the world’s first nuclear power plant was built at Sellafield in England in 1955.  
       
    The war also spurred the development of technologies that continue to play vital roles in modern society. Frank Whittle (1907-1996) and Hans van Ohain (1911-1998) independently and simultaneously developed working jet engines, Werner  von Braun (1912-1977) pioneered guided rocket technology, Robert Watson-Watt (1892-1973) developed modern radar and Konrad Zuse (1910-1995) and Tommy Flowers (1905-1998) built the world’s first digital programmable computer. In the field of medicine American scientists developed the discovery of Penicillin by Alexander Fleming (1881-1955) to create the field of antibiotic drugs - a treatment that would save countless millions of lives over the rest of the remainder of the 20th century. Inevitably in a war the maimed millions, surgery, in particular plastic surgery, developed markedly during the conflict.   
       
    In the aftermath of the Second World War, even more than in the aftermath of the First World War, the leaders of Western nations and their peoples sought to create a peaceful, liberal democratic world. The framework for the United Nations was established in 1942 and the organisation itself was founded in 1945 on a basis first sketched out by the US State Department. All the warring nations in Western Europe emerged from the conflict as liberal democracies which guaranteed the rights of the individuals. The West also gained a hard border: the Iron Curtain which divided Europe between states occupied by Soviet Russia and those states established as liberal democracies allied to the United States. NATO was established in 1949 as a means of ensuring the defence of liberal democracies. In 1957 Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg formed the European Economic Community (EEC) with the aim of promoting a single European market, ensuring the survival of European democracy and ending the destructive ideology of European nationalism. The EEC would develop over time into the European Union, a political and economic union which embraced the former dictatorships of southern and eastern Europe and enabled them to develop as functioning liberal democracies. In 1944 the Western allies held the Breton Woods Conference which established international economic framework designed to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Great Depression and to promote global economic growth. The Breton Woods system promoted open markets and global trade, and established the International Monetary Fund and later the World Bank. These institutions and the framework of global free trade underpinned unprecedented global economic growth for the rest of the 20th century.  
       
    Millions of men across Britain, America and their allies had been conscripted into their national armies and fought for the idea of freedom, liberty and democracy. These citizen soldiers returned home and, with some justification, demanded new societies which allowed them the opportunity to prosper has private citizens. This desire for a new, fairer and more equal society was democratically demonstrated by the victory of the social democrat Labour party over Britain’s great war leader Winston Churchill in the 1945 General Election. Clement Attlee’s (1883-1967) Labour Party went on to implement a comprehensive welfare state which aimed to cater for citizen’s fundamental needs from cradle to grave with the provision of free healthcare, education, pensions and unemployment and sickness welfare. Almost all European Governments implemented similarly comprehensive welfare programmes for their citizens; In less than 50 years the main role of the European nation state had gone from enforcing the rule of law and maintaining a standing army, to meeting the basic everyday needs of its citizens. British women, who had proven their equality to men through service in the armed services and vital areas of wartime employment saw their service recognised with the granting of universal suffrage some 50 years after the female suffrage movement had begun in earnest.  
       
    In the United States GIs returned home to a economy that was booming thanks to the record industrial demand created by an industrial war fought on a global scale. The G.I. Bill which offered free technical, vocational or college eduction benefitted some 2.2 million returning G.I.s. The United States, determined to learn the lessons of the Treaty Versailles, also extended generous economic aid to the shattered countries of Europe, allied and foe alike. The Marshall Plan was implemented in 1948 and over the next four years provide $13 billion dollars in reconstruction aid to the economies of Western Europe.   
       
    The thirty years after 1945 would see a transformation in living stages which was beyond comparison to the changes in living standards that had occurred in the West during the first and second industrial revolutions, (which had themselves been dramatic).  
       
    High increases in productivity which had started in the second industrial revolution took off agin in earnest after the disruptions of two world wars and the Great Depression. The mechanisation of agriculture through adoption of tractors, harvesters and the widespread adoption of chemical fertilisers  allowed the rapid recovery of the agricultural sector following the devastation of the war and subsequent years of depravation experienced by Europeans.  
       
    The economies of France, Germany and Italy underwent seemingly miraculous growth in the thirty years after the end of the war as all three economies caught up with and overtook that of Britain, which was itself enjoying its greatest recorded growth in absolute prosperity. In France the period is today known as the Trente Glorieuses, in Germany it is the Wirtshaftwunder and in Italy the Miracle Economico.  
       
    In Italy between 1958 and 1965, the percentage of families owning a television rose from 12% to 49%, washing machines from 3% to 23%, and refrigerators from 13% to 55%. In Germany the the purchasing power of wages increasing by 73% from 1950 to 1960 while unemployment remained below 1% as the country rebuilt its world leading industrial economy. Almost without exception all Western economies experienced an economic boom between 1945 and 1973 which transformed the lives of ordinary people faster than at any time in history. Consumer goods such as televisions, fridges and cars were available to all but the poorest citizens by the end of the period. People had seemingly ever increasing disposable income to spend on leisure and holidays - with foreign holidays becoming culturally normal for working class northern Europeans by the 1980s.  
       
    With increasing time and money to spend on leisure, popular culture became a new defining feature of Western society and Western corporations increasingly came to see young people with money to spend on leisure and culture as an important new market. Youth culture emerged during this period. Modern Western popular music emerged from the music of the descendants of African American slaves. Jazz, gospel, soul and rhythm and blues emerged from African American culture and thanks to the gramophone had already become popular in white society in Europe and America in the 1930s. Swing music, had morphed from these influences and became extremely popular with ordinary men and women during the 1940s.  Elvis Presley (1935-1977) was also strongly inspired by African American music and developed the new style of music known as Rock and Roll in the process of selling 600 million records during his career as one of the first global pop stars.  
       
    By the 1960s these various styles of music had morphed to form two main musical genres that remain the most popular across the world today rock music and pop music, (the latter pioneered by the African American dominated Motown music). Bands such as the Beatles and Rolling Stones are just two examples of hundreds of artists that establish rock and pop music as a form of art in their own right but also created the soundtrack to Western and latterly global life - a soundtrack that was and largely still is dominated by British and American artists.  
       
    Western cultural influence was further reinforced through the medium of film, and while many countries established their own film industries after 1945, none were able to match the scope, scale and distribution of the American film industry which projected a vision of American life across the world. Western art after World War Two continued its journey towards the abstract and the expressionist through multiple movements and groups. Artists such as Robert Rauschenberg (1925-2008), Mark Rothko (1903-1970), Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) and Andy Warhol (1928-1987) and many others continued to explore the boundaries of what was considered to be art and in the case of Warhol used art to comment on role the mass-consumption and advertising in a changing society.  
       
    Hollywood films, rock and pop music and modern art all reflected the changes that occurred in Western society after the war. What we recognise today as modern Western culture began to take shape in this post war year. As democracy became firmly established, citizens grew richer and better educated Western societies, and European societies became increasingly liberal. In 1960 Dr Gregory Pincus (1903-1967) and John Rock (1890-1980) developed the first female contraceptive pills, which became widely available in the 1960s and gave Western women much more control over their sexuality. There can have been few more transformative inventions than the contraceptive bill, a product that gave half the population control over their own body and allowed them to pursue happiness without the inevitability of childbirth and marriage decisions made in distress. Perhaps more than anything the pill allowed both men and women the opportunity to enjoy the Enlightenment idea that humans have inalienable right to pursue personal happiness. Fashion quickly developed to reflect increasingly liberal values and female emancipation. One item in particular, the two-piece swimwear item christened the bikini, reflected the relatively liberated position of women in society.  
       
    During the 1960s a liberal social revolution took place across the West. Capital punishment was gradually outlawed in Western Europe in the 1960s (although it is currently retained in many American states). Similarly a series of incremental freedoms were granted to homosexuals, with homosexuality gradually being legalised across Europe and America during the 1960s, although it would be another 50 years before same-sex marriage was legalised across Western Europe. The liberal attitudes towards sexuality that developed during the latter half of the 20th century were increasingly in conflict with the dogmas of the established Churches. In other times conflict between society, state and Church could have culminated in bitter social conflict; in the late 20th century the Church was instead, increasingly irrelevant.   
       
    Church attendance declined across Western Europe and whilst the majority of people continued to state a belief in a God, religion itself increasingly shrank as a force in society, just as sorcery, witches and magic had disappeared during the 17th century. Whether this gradual disappearance of religion was caused by increased education, greater prosperity or a number of other causes, the West and in particular Europe, stands apart from much of the Middle East and South Asia in the low levels of religiosity displayed by its inhabitants.  
       
    Western science continued to provide new technologies and discoveries that transformed economies and societies across the world. The science of biology caught up with the breakthroughs previously achieved in chemistry and biology when in 1943 Oswald Avery identified that genes were carried by DNA. In 1955 Francis Crick (1916-2004) and James Watson (1928-) discovered the double-helix structure of DNA, in 1984 Alec Jeffries (1950-) developed DNA fingerprinting . Jonas Edward Salk (1914-1995) developed the first vaccine for polio which led to the virtual worldwide eradication of the disease by the 1990s. In vitro fertilisation was developed by Robert Edwards (1925-2013) and Patrick Steptoe (1913-1988) and has since helped millions of couples across the world to start families. The cloning of frogs was achieved by John Gurdon (1933-) in the late 1950s and the first sheep was cloned by Ian Wilmut (1944-) in the 1990s.  
       
    Despite the continued breakthroughs achieved by Western scientists in the post-1945 era, and for the first time since the 1400s, Western countries also faced significant technological and scientific rivalry from other parts of the world. The Soviet Union embarked on an ambitious programme of scientific and technological research which culminated in it sending the first satellite and first human into space in 1957 and 1961 respectively during the Cold War ‘Space Race’ - the quest be the first civilisation to put a man on the moon.   
       
    The United States responded to the Soviet competition by pouring investment into its national space agency, NASA, and on 21 July 1969 Neil Armstrong (1930-2012) became the first human to walk on the surface of the moon. Few moments can have been so iconic and full of symbolism for the human race than those of a human working on the surface of extraterrestrial body and the film of planet earth from rising from the moon’s alien horizon. Although the United States had won the ‘space race’ it would go on to send probes which mapped and explored all of the planets in the Solar System. The Voyager I and II probes launched in 1977 went on to become the first man-made objects to have reached the edge of the solar system.  
       
    At the very moment that Neil Armstrong took that iconic photograph of planet earth from the surface of the moon, thousands of his countrymen were involved in a bloody and intractable war in the forests and mountains of South Vietnam. The United States had begun the period after the Second World War promising  a brave new world in which the rights of countries to self-determination and democracy would be safeguarded and the international rule of law upheld. The old European powers were encouraged to begin the process of decolonisation across Asia and Africa, a process the Britain had precipitated when it granted independence to India and East and West Pakistan in 1947. By the late 1960s the European empires that had once covered more than a third of the world’s land surface and been reduced to a few scattered territories and remote archipelagos.   
       
    The post war optimism was quickly replaced by Cold War paranoia, however, and the United States soon found itself propping up and even actively supporting posts-colonial regimes in Africa and Asia with vile records on human rights and political corruption - problems which plague many ex-colonial states as a result to this day. America found that it was sometimes not enough to prop-up a dictator at arms length whilst holding its nose - and so it was that it found itself sucked into a post colonial civil war in Vietnam, supporting the South Vietnamese dictatorship against a determined and ruthless North Vietnamese army.  America had tragically misinterpreted a post-colonial war of independence and national re-unification as being a key battle in the Cold War struggle to maintain some abstract notion of the need to stop the spread of Communism at a certain arbitrary point on the world map. America used almost every weapon in its vast arsenal to defeat the North Vietnamese and in doing so it killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and destabilised neighbouring Laos and Cambodia into the bargain. The war quickly became deeply unpopular across the world with particularly vociferous protests being organised by students on the campuses of America and Western Europe.   
       
    In these protests we can see now the stirring of a meme which continues to this day, that Western Culture represented the subjugation of non-Western nations and the post-1945 foreign policy was simply a continuation of the imperialist policies of the 19th century Western states. The United States, it is true, killed many innocent people and caused immense destruction during its disastrous war in Vietnam. France and Britain too committed atrocities and waged pointless wars during the decolonisation of their African and Asian possessions. However, the relativist meme that at its most benign is ambivalent to the positive features and achievements of Western culture and at worst sympathised with retrograde and harmful practices associated with non-western cultures is something that is as prevalent now as it was in the 1960s.  
       
    Cultural relativism is a problem that the West is still grappling with in the 21st century especially as it seeks to integrate the millions of migrants who have fled poverty and wars in Africa and Asia over the last twenty years. But is worth remembering the progress that has been made with regard to integration and race relations within living memory. The United States with its large population of blacks descended from freed slaves has long been at the forefront of incorporating different racial and cultural groups into a cohesive society.   
       
    The anti-slavery Union forces won the civil war of the 1860s but after the conflict and the abolition of slavery the southern states were largely left to run their own affairs.Endemic racism and legally enforced segregation remain in place across the south throughout the next 100 years until the issue of race became part of the growing movement towards social liberalism. From the early 1960s ordinary black men and women, supported by northern white liberals and led by civiv leaders such Dr Martin Luther King (1929-1968) began a long running series of peaceful mass-protests that led to the Civil Rights Act 1964 which prohibited discrimination on the grounds of sex, race or religion. But it was not just America that had to confront the problem of racism within its society, from the 1960s onwards Britain, France, the Netherlands and many other Western European countries received steady flows of immigrants from their former colonies, attracted by the plentiful jobs available in the booming economies.   
       
    Although Europe did not have the same history of segregation as the American south, racism and discrimination still existed nonetheless. With varying levels of commitment and alacrity European Governments addressed these problems by implementing legislation that prohibited discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity, for example the Race Relations Act passed enacted in Britain in 1965.  
       
    Racism continued to be a real problem in Western European societies through to the 1980s but with varying degrees of success all Western states have talked this challenge through a combination of legislation and other initiatives. Although no one would say that racism has been eradicated, the West has established a legislative and social framework aimed at ensuring that all citizens have access to the same rights, protections and opportunities regardless of their sex, race, or religion.  
       
    In the three decades after the Second World War Western Europe had grown from a devastated and impoverished continent to a collection of societies which were democratic, socially liberal, multi-racial and economically successful. During those thirty or so years the material quality of life for ordinary workers had seen another quantum shift. In the 1940s food was scarce and many countries continued to operate a system of food rationing, by the 1970s an ordinary worker could expect to own a car, a range of electrical consumer appliances from refrigerators to TVs, have money to spend on leisure activities and holidays and even own their own home. Increasingly too, the children of ordinary working class parents born in the 1950s, the so-called baby-boomers could enjoy access to university educations and entry into well paid white collar or middle class professions.   
       
    The 1970s represents the period in which the differences between the West and the rest of the world were at their most striking. The average American worker was more than 30 times richer than his Chinese counterpart at this time. With exception of Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, few non-Western countries had been able to establish successful economies that met even the basic needs and aspirations of their citizens. Fewer still had established democracies or social institutions that channelled popular discontent into positive and constructive change. At the same time Western agricultural techniques and medical advances meant that a sustained population boom occurred in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Without successful economies to provide enough jobs to meet the increase in people, or democratic institutions to channel discontent, many non-Western countries began a slide into the Malthusian Trap.  
       
    However, the 1970s may have marked the high-water mark of Western cultural, economic and technological dominance. In 1973 Opec the cartel of oil-producing states organising a price-hike which ended the era of cheap oil enjoyed by Western economies since 1945. At the same time many of the traditional heavy manufacturing and mining industries that had been established during the Industrial Revolution began to decline in the West in the face of competition from newly industrialising Asian states and new technologies began to make the old industries obsolete.  
       
    The relative decline of heavy industry in the 1970s contributed to a considerable cultural and economic shock to the affected areas in the United States and northern Europe, the effects of which are still being felt today. The de-industrialisation of certain areas was an early indicator of the economic competition the West would face as China and other areas of Asia joined Japan and South Korea in embracing a market based economy.   
       
    Japan had embraced the Western economic model in the late 19th century and had long had a powerful and efficient industrial economy. In the 1970s and 1980s Japan became the first non-Western country since the 1400s to produce groundbreaking technological advances such as the pocket calculator, CD player, flash memory drives and video players as well as significant advances in robotics and computers.  
       
    But just as 500 years of technological and scientific advances in the West has helped people across the world, so too have Western consumers benefitted from innovation in Japan and South Korea. Indeed Japan and Germany have been the two big success stories of the American constructed post-1945 world. Both nations formerly saw militaristic nationalism as representing the path to national success but since 1945 both have embraced democracy, pacifism, global co-operation and free trade as the path to be taken. For all the talk of the downsides of globalisation, it must be remembered that this is a concept that has taken the world away from the zero-sum world of economic nationalism towards an era where countries have enjoy symbiotic relationships involving economic trade and sharing of technological advances.  
       
    By the early 1980s the Cold War tensions were still high with no end to the ideological between free market west and communist east in sight and American commentators also saw the rise of the Japanese economy as a threat to American hegemony.  
       
    Few people at that time could have recognised that the world was about to undergo a technological and economic transformation so profound that it might be characterised as the Third Industrial Revolution. The 1980s saw the advent of the Digital Age an era that would help improve the lives of almost every citizen in the world and revolutionised the communication of information.  
       
       
    The Digital Age  
       
       
    The concept of the modern computer was described by the British scientist Alan Turing (1912-1954) and the first digital computers had been invented during the Second World War to assist with top secret Government codebreaking projects in Britain and America. After the war computers developed slowly but steadily over the next thirty years and were largely used for data processing by large corporations and Government departments.  
       
    Engineers working at Bell Laboratories invented the transistor in 1948, the following year the Xerox Corporation introduced the first photocopier and Geoffrey Dummer (1909-2002), invented the integrated circuit chip in 1956. Improvements made to the integrated circuit by Jack Kilby (1923-2005) allowed the first great post-war advance in computing power, this was followed by the invention of the microprocessor which was independently and simultaneously developed by three different commercial projects in the very same year: 1971.   
       
    The resulting exponential increases in computing power allowed personal computers to be developed in the 1980s. The first desktop computer had been developed by Pier Giorgio Perotto (1930 - 2002) in 1964 and various prototype models were developed in subsequent years with the first commercial models being released in the late 1970s by Apple, Commodore International and the Tandy Corporation and TIME magazine named the home computer as the machine of the year in 1982.   
       
    Computer processing power and sales grew exponentially from 1977 - when 48,000 units were shipped - through to 1998, when more than 100 million units were shipped worldwide. An exponential trend that has shown no sign of slowing in the 21st century. These new mass-produced personal computers were able to make use of von Neumann programme architecture, invented by John von Neumann (1903-1957), which enabled computers to run programmes and applications such as word processing. In 1975 in Alberquerque, New Mexico two childhood friends, Bill Gates (1955-) and Paul Allen (1953-), saw the potential for computer programming and co-founded the Microsoft Corporation. In 1985 they developed Microsoft Windows which would go on to be used by billions of people and millions of business across the world.  
       
    Just as the increases in processing power allowed computers to be shrunk enough to fit inside peoples homes, telephones also developed from a device fixed into peoples homes to a product small enough to fit into a trouser pocket. The concept of modern cellular telephones had been developed by Bell Laboratories in the 1960s but the first handheld cell phone was developed by Martin Cooper (1928-) of Motorola in 1973. Cellphones and their corresponding networks were developed by Japan, the United States and several Western European countries so that by the 2000s there were more than seven billion handsets in use world wide; more than the total global population at the time. Indeed few electronic products can have been distributed to such a wide population of the planet so quickly, with almost members of every socio-economic group - from billionaires to Kalahari bushmen - able to make use of the technology.  
       
    The exponential growth in computing power since the early 1980s allowed vast amounts of data to be stored, computed and most importantly communicated via computer units. The concept of an internet was developed by academics in Western Europe and America after the Second World War and numerous developments allowed this concept to become a feasible reality.   
       
    Between 1984 and 1988 CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research set up the first intranet system to connect its computers. Tim Berners-Lee (1955-) a British computer scientist working at CERN proposed that the system should be developed into a world wide internet system named the world wide web, with the world’s first website created on 6 August 1991. Perhaps even more than the spread of computers, the internet has had a revolutionary impact on society and commerce. In 1993 only 1% of telecommunications data was transmitted via the internet in 2007 that had increased to 97%.   
       
    Instant communication via email (invented by Ray Tomlinson 1941-2016) and other forms of messaging have transformed the way people communicate with each other. Huge amounts of free data is now open to anyone in a way that is accessible and easily searchable. Other advances that have taken place since the 1970s and have quickly become essential to the world include the GPS developed by Ivan Getting (1912-2003) and Bradford Parkinson (1935-) and the digital camera (invented by Steven Sasoon 1950-).  
       
    The personal computer, the mobile phone and the internet are three of the great Western inventions of the last thirty years. They are products that are available to the very poorest people, not just in the West but across the world and have improved the lives of countless millions.   
       
    By 1989 the West was continuing to enjoy economic prosperity, fuelled by a move towards liberalisation of markets in Britain and the United States, at the same time as its societies became increasingly liberal and at ease with themselves. The West had seemingly successfully overcome the challenges of oil embargoes, the decline of heavy industry, multiculturalism, the expansion of the welfare state and competition posed by emerging markets.  
       
    The attraction of life in the liberal democratic West, as opposed to the supposedly utopian Communist east, was evident to Eastern Europeans caught behind the Iron Curtain. That year a series of peaceful protests spread across Eastern Europe and led to to the dramatically swift collapse of the Soviet Empire and the dismantling of the physical divide between Eastern and Western Europe. The Soviet Union itself collapsed under its own weight two years later.   
       
    By 1991 the United States emerged as the world’s sole superpower and policeman and the Western model of liberal democracy, individual liberty and free markets seemed to have few if any rivals. The United States found its role as global policemen a difficult one to master, but successfully forced Iraqi forces to end their occupation of Kuwait and intervened to stop war crimes against civilians in the civil wars in Bosnia and Kosovo.   
       
    At the dawn of the 21st century Western liberalism still appeared to have seen off all challenges, but the next ten years would present some of the most profound global shocks since the Second World War. 9/11 brought a shocked world to the realisation that not all cultures accepted Western values. The response of the United States under George W Bush (1946-) was maladroit and populist. The blundering occupation of Iraq, the use of torture and the establishment of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility achieved nothing of strategic value and echoed the Vietnam War in its mobilisation of world opinion against the concept of Western civilisation.                
       
    Even as the United States was extracting itself from its Iraqi quagmire, the economies of the West were hit by a financial crisis as severe as that of 1929; only the skilful, if tardy, response of central bankers and political leaders averted an subsequent economic slump on the scale of the Great Depression.  
       
    The shock of the 2008 financial crisis and the scale of the resulting economic downturn damaged the popular support for liberal markets and globalisation in Europe and the United States. At the same time scepticism regarding the benefits of multiculturalism and mass immigration grew. Islamic extremism highlighted the difficulties associated with integrating immigrant communities with highly conservative social and religious views that sometimes seemed to be in direct opposition to the values of their host societies.  
       
    The uncertainty posed by industrial decline, economic shocks and rapid cultural change contributed to a movement that revived a kind of soft nationalism amongst traditionalists and conservatives in Western countries. This amorphous movement developed under the radar of mainstream politicians until it crystallised in 2016 in the form of two shock political events: ’Brexit’ and the election of Donald Trump (1946-). To many commentators these events, in the two traditional leaders of liberal democracy, portended the end of liberalism on the West.   
       
    The era of Western led globalisation has been hugely beneficial to the world. Between 1950 and 2015 global average real incomes per head rose by 460%, the proportion of the world’s population in extreme poverty fell from 72% to 10%, global life expectancy at birth rose from 48 to 71 and the proportion of people living in democracies rose from 31% to 56%.It remains to be seen what the effect of populism in the West will be but, if the West decides to withdraw into itself and turn its back on the world then the world, including the West, will be a poorer place.  
       
       
    The West Today  
       
       
    The culture we refer to as ‘the West’ began to develop in the western part of the European continent (and later European off-shoots in North America and Australasia) from 1500 onwards. At its best Western Civilisation represents a culture in which rational enquiry trumps superstition, in which social progress trumps tradition, and which embraces the values of democracy, the rule of law, tolerance and individual liberty. Different parts of the West embraced these ideas at different rates of progress, Britain was an early adopter; Spain did not fully commit to liberal democracy until the 1980s, but has since gone on to become one the world’s most socially liberal societies.   
       
    At various times Western states have had to fight existential threats from within, the American Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery; in the 20th century Europe tore itself apart when fascism offered a rival, hellish vision of the future. The West’s geographic boundaries have been hard to define. Europe east of the River Oder was for long periods subjugated by absolutist monarch and did not begin to throw off the shackles of feudalism until the 19th century. Eastern Europe was literally cut off from the West by a physical barrier during the Cold War and is still culturally distinct from its Western European neighbours. Russia had historically flirted with Western culture but failed to reform the medieval structure of its society before the First World War which precipitated a Communist takeover. Modern Russian society has not quite recovered from the dramatic fall of the Soviet empire and President Putin’s Russia currently stands in self-declared opposition to the West.   
       
    The West’s southern borders with the Muslim world are harder and are much longer established. In medieval times knowledge of the ancient world and contemporary science was transmitted between the two worlds, but the two cultures but ultimately they drew away from each other and closed in on themselves. Europeans shared a common religion and latin script and were united under the Pope; Sunni Arabs shared a common religion and common language and were united under the Caliph. The two civilisations consequently evolved along different paths.  
       
    Critics of the idea of Western Civilisation often claim that the West has diffuse and undefinable borders, that may be true but the borders of nation states may wax and wane over the centuries, it does not follow that the nation states themselves cease to exist.  
       
    The same detractors often also point out that the West has been guilty of many of the worst transgressions  to which it is supposedly opposed. That is also true, but it is also to miss the point.   
       
    Western culture did not emerge fully formed in the year 1500, the history of the West since that date is the history of countless transformative events - as opposed to the relatively uneventful earlier periods and histories of pre-industrial societies - in which the lives of ordinary people did not change from one century to the next. The key point about the story of the West is that is has been the story of change, sometimes through struggle and war, sometimes through argument and debate but often through a process of education, feedback and communication of thoughts and ideas and by careful and rigorous method.  
       
    Neither does recognition of the achievements of Western Civilisation mean that there is nothing to learn or appreciate in non-Western cultures. The history of the West is suffused with adoptions from the wider world, from Arabic translations of Classical scholars, medieval Chinese technology, the importation of spices and foodstuffs, through to the establishment of oriental studies as a serious academic discipline in the 17th century. The West has a history of racism and discrimination - like all societies - but the West today is one of the few areas of the world which maintain genuinely open, pluralistic, multi-cultural societies.  
       
    Since the pioneering of the modern scientific method in the 1500s Western World has been the leading force in the technological and scientific disciplines its scientific discoveries and technological inventions have transformed and improved life for the entire world. Without the Haber-Bosch process of creating fertiliser for example, it is estimated that half of all people alive today could not be fed, countless millions of others have been saved by Western medical advances such as antibiotics and the eradication of polio.  
    Culture and identity are as old as human civilisation. They already existed when humans began to form farming settlements separate and distinctive cultures and ways of organising society began to emerge. These different cultures did trade with each other, sometimes extensively, but for the large part, the great pre-industrial Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East developed separate and often very different world views.  From the 1500s onwards Western nations began to impose their own ideas and views on the world, often this led to negative impacts such as slavery and subjugation, but on the whole the rest of the world has benefitted from Westernisation. In considering the impact of the West one must take into account the material benefits derived from the ending of the global slave trade, the establishment of a global trading system, the provision of modern medicine, mechanised farming and fertilisation techniques, and mass education - not to mention countless technological inventions including railways, motor vehicles and telecommunications.   
    Al nations and all peoples have been net beneficiaries of the economic and material advances achieved by the West, the more intangible features of Western culture such as liberal democracy, minority rights, and freedom of expression have been less successfully adopted. In fairness some of these values, now held sacred by westerners, are relatively new additions to the features of Western culture and can only be accepted by a society following a sustained period of social change.    
    Westerners should not be embarrassed to observe that the changes and developments related in this book did not occur in other cultures at the same pace, or even at all. To take Saudi Arabia as a clear example, the culture of the interior of the Gulf peninsular was largely cut off from world events for a thousand years. Following the discovery of oil within its territory Saudi citizens have been able to enjoy technological modernity (except cinemas) whilst living in a society that maintains a world view unchanged since the time of the Quran.  
    Religious absolutism and social conservatism remain powerful forces in Africa and the Middle East. Political authoritarianism trumps liberal democracy in China and Russia and a politicised, absolutist interpretation of Islam offers a vision of salvation accepted millions across the world. But the economic prosperity, stability, protection and personal liberties offered by Western societies mean that the West continues to act as a magnet for peoples from South America through to Africa, the Middle East and Asia.  
    The demography of the West has changed radically since 1945. Despite the ongoing existence of racism, the West has created successfully create multi-cultural and diverse (sometimes hyper-diverse) societies. The concepts of liberalism, democracy, freedom of expression and of sexuality are considered to be universal human rights by most Westerners regardless of race or religion.  
    It cannot be denied, however, that some immigrant groups reject the concept of universal and human rights and claim their right, implied in Western liberalism, to live according to their own values. Some Western states have tried to square this circle by tentatively implementing the ideas of common values; often detractors of integration refer to the liberal concept of live and let live, so long as no harm is being done.   
    This is to misunderstand liberalism and the history of the West. Western society has never been a laissez-faire, anarchist utopia in which citizens have full rights and entitlements, but no obligations to society. Western society has succeeded by and large, through debate, freedom of expression and by enshrining values that allow individual liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Whether individual liberty and happiness can be achieved by neglecting to challenge patriarchal cultures in which religious dogma, superstition and misogyny remains doubtful. At worst Western nations may be condemning the citizens of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian to exclusion from the rights that are otherwise considered to be universal.  
    The changing nature of Western demographics and the increasing liberalisation of society and the competition posed by emerging global economies has caused some in the West to turn in on themselves and reject the ever increasing pace of societal change. In 2016 Britain and America the two leading advocates of liberal democracy, free trade and market economies suffered populist backlashes with the electoral success of the Brexit and  Donald Trump (1946-) respectively. Both campaigns were a rejection of the changes that have taken place in the West over the last thirty years, it remains to be seen how damaging the effects of their electoral success will be. What is clear is that the populist nativism of Trump and the Brexiters are painful misreadings of Western history.  
    The West has had difficult and sometimes shameful periods in its history, which it should not forget. But neither should the West forget its great achievements in forging a world of universal values and economic prosperity, in which citizens enjoy fundamental right to pursue personal happiness and share in the wealth created by market economies and modern technology and whose life expectancies have trebled since the Middle Ages. The world population has grown from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 7 billion today, the average human alive today is nine times richer than their predecessors in 1500, the number of democracies has grown from around a dozen in 1914 to around 90 today. These achievements were not inevitable and were only achieved through debate, struggle, education endeavour and dedication.  
       
    Although challenged by competing world views espoused by Putin’s Russia, Communist China and religious fascists in the Middle East, the West remains a civilisation that offers tremendous hope to humanity. Western nations are still the key underwriter of international institutions such as the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, and global agreements to prevent climate change. Of the top 10 donors of international aid only two states are not Western. The top 20 nations in the UN global happiness and human development indices are almost exclusively Western.   
       
    In recent years the West has continued to act as a world leader in human progress, Western politicians have accepted hundreds of thousands of refugees from wars in the Middle East and legalised gay marriage, Western scientists have pioneered the flight of the first electric plane, sequenced the human genome, observed the Higgs boson particle, verified the existence of gravitational waves and sent probes to the outer edges of the Solar System.   
       
    The world can still benefit from a liberal, open and progressive West; but in order to benefit the world, first the West needs to learn to understand itself.
