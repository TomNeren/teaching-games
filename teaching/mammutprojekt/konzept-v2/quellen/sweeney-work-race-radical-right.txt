Introduction

In late September 1905, a number of leading social reformers and representatives of German heavy industry met in Mannheim at the annual general
meeting of the Association for Social Policy (Verein für Sozialpolitik), the
preeminent social reform organization in imperial Germany, for a debate
over “labor relations in private large-scale industrial enterprises.”1 Against
the backdrop of rising labor militancy—especially the recent miners’ strike
in the Ruhr—and the increasingly aggressive antiunionism of German
industrialists, most of the reformers at Mannheim called for fundamental
institutional changes to the industrial workplace, changes that would allow
for negotiations between employers and employees over the conditions of
work and curb the excessive power of German industrialists over their
workers. The sociologist Max Weber, responding to the comments of
heavy industry spokesman Alexander Tille, focused his criticism on labor
relations in the Saar Valley, a region of coal mining and iron and steel manufacturing in the southwest corner of the Prussian Rhine Province. The
Saar was best known as the home of the late iron and steel magnate and
Free Conservative politician Carl Ferdinand von Stumm-Halberg, once
imperial Germany’s most vocal exponent of the paternalist factory regime,
which combined far-reaching disciplinary and moralizing work rules with
extensive company welfare bene‹ts, from wage bonuses to housing. The
work rules in Saar factories, Weber maintained in Mannheim, resembled
“police jargon.” As such, he argued, they re›ected “German traditions”:
the striving for the “appearance of power” rather than real power; the
“petty bourgeois thrill of being a gentleman” (spiessbürgerliche Her-

2

renkitzel) revealed in the actions of the industrial paterfamilias, who had to
show “those under him” that he “has something to say”; and the authoritarianism inherent in the paternalist “system” generally.
I myself . . . know very well the Saar region and the suffocating atmosphere which this system has created there—not for you, Dr. Tille,
but for others, and not just for workers but for any who dare to be
politically active in any way that displeases these men [i.e., Saar
employers]. Gymnasium teachers, of‹cials, and all with whom I came
in contact at the time con‹rmed that anyone considered a civil servant—up to and including the Oberpräsident [Provincial Governor]—
dances to the tune of these men, that any independent point of view
risked the threat of transfer or reprimand.2
In ways that summarized the views of most liberal reformers, Weber
argued that the paternalist factory regime was founded on a “contract of
subordination” that violated “modern notions of legality.” Much like the
“authoritarian” Prussian state, it turned workers into subjects or “rabble”
(Kanaille) rather than “honorable citizens.” In this way, Weber interpreted
the labor policies and factory regimes in Saar heavy industry as relics from
a premodern or feudal past.
Nevertheless, the defense of employers mounted in Mannheim by
industry spokesmen Tille and Eugen Leidig, deputy chairman of the Central Association of German Industrialists (Centralverband Deutscher
Industrieller, hereafter CVDI), contained little of the moralizing claims of
employers like Stumm or the familiar features of Saar paternalism—its
description of the employer as economic and moral “provider” for workers, its repeated invocation of a “personal relationship between employer
and employee,” and its support for state Sozialpolitik. Instead, Tille
assailed what he regarded as the unscienti‹c and “social-moral” claims of
the reformers, their calls for more state welfare programs and institutional
mechanisms for workplace bargaining, and he defended employer prerogative in terms of a scienti‹c and technocratic vision of work relations and
economic ef‹ciency. The terms and conditions of work in large industrial
concerns, Tille maintained, could not be set according to the inapplicable,
arti‹cial, egalitarian, homogenizing, and ethical considerations that motivated state-sponsored welfare and workplace regulation. Rather, they
should be determined by natural biological and economic laws, which pit-

ted workers of differing bioracial capacities against each other in healthy
competition, and by the quality of a worker’s “performance” (Leistung) on
the job. In a technocratic formulation that stressed the importance of the
“entrepreneur” (Unternehmer) as a general category of producer, Tille also
criticized state-sanctioned arbitration bodies and increasing state regulation of the industrial workplace as threats to “economic freedom”—“our
greatest good”—and to the “personal freedom” of employers and workers
equally to choose with whom and under what conditions they would work.
This departure from the paternalist language of Stumm would be incorporated three years later into a more systematic corporatist discourse about
a racially de‹ned social order composed of “occupational estates” (Berufsstände), in which a “social aristocracy” of “productive employers” was
called on to defend its prerogatives and the conditions of capitalist
pro‹tability against trade unions, irresponsible social reformers, meddlesome political parties, and an interventionist welfare state.
Leidig’s response to the reformers at Mannheim also departed from
the once standard paternalist references and claims of industrialists and
emphasized the changed context of labor relations in German heavy
industry after 1900. The CVDI deputy chairman defended the freedom of
the “purely economic” labor contract and the prerogatives of employers in
heavy industry in terms of the organizational and economic imperatives of
industrial production in an age of joint stock companies and global markets. He argued that “inside the factory the authoritarian position of the
employer should be protected and maintained not . . . in the sense of a
tsarist autocracy but in the sense of an organization,” which, like any
organization involved in a “dif‹cult competition,” must be led by a single,
“unitary will.” In Leidig’s view, the employer (Unternehmer) was caught in
a global competition for markets, bound to a much wider community of
capital investors, and thus more restricted than ever in his room for
maneuver than paternalist employers who once owned their own factories.
Moreover, he found himself increasingly on the defensive—and not at all
the “stronger” partner in the wage relationship—in the “new epoch of
struggle” between workers and management de‹ned by mass unionism
and the regional and national organization of employers after 1900. Leidig
identi‹ed the encroachments of trade unions, social reformers, and state
regulators as looming threats, architects of an impending “socialist state,”
but he concentrated on two weapons available to workers as the principal
threats to employers.

4

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

The one is the universal and equal franchise, which has been put in the
hands of workers; the other is public opinion and the press, which is
likewise today used in a comprehensive way by the workers. With
their silent, steady, pressing authority, these institutions, which
redound to the bene‹t of workers in no other nation in the civilized
world to this extent, force all political parties to engage in the struggle
for the votes of workers. Their enduring effect is to place German
employers under an in›uence that, each and every time they impose a
disciplinary sanction, forces them to consider most carefully the question: is it absolutely necessary to reject the demands of the worker?3
Like Tille’s, Leidig’s arguments about the organization of labor con›ict,
mass politics, and the growing power of public opinion registered the corporatist restructuring of German political economy—understood here in
terms of the increasing interpenetration of economic and party-political
spheres—and pointed to a range of new concerns that transformed
employer discourses about work and industrial organization in late imperial Germany.
German historians have not yet fully appreciated the changing terms
of this debate or political struggle over factory organization and the transformation of employer discourses in Germany during the decade before
1914. Until recently, they had been mainly preoccupied, like Max Weber,
with the allegedly “premodern” or “feudal” origins of paternalist or corporatist labor policies in German heavy industry—an interpretation that
derived its staying power from the Sonderweg (special path) thesis about
the long-term origins of Nazism. Consolidated during the 1960s and 1970s
by the practitioners of “historical social science” (Gesellschaftsgeschichte),
a largely Weberian reformulation of modernization theory applied to
social historical writing, the Sonderweg thesis stressed the fundamental
divergence of German sociopolitical development from the developmental
trajectories of the “West.” It emphasized the fatal disjuncture between a
highly advanced industrial economy and a backward, illiberal political
system and culture, which prevented the “normal” evolution of parliamentary democracy out of the social energies released by industrial capitalism.4 The “preindustrial” elites and social groups that prevented this
model of development came from the aristocracy, the civil bureaucracy,
and the army, but they were joined by industrialists like Stumm and
Krupp, as well as a younger “cohort” of Ruhr “manager-entrepreneurs”
like Emil Kirdorf, Fritz Baare, or Hanns Jencke, who aped the illiberal

Introduction

values of traditional elites in political outlook and lifestyle.5 Their desire to
remain “master of the house” (Herr im Hause) in the factory, according to
Han-Ulrich Wehler, re›ected a “residual style of traditional leadership”
that rejected capitalist “market rationality” and the economic bene‹ts that
came with “modern” managerial practices and the acceptance of trade
unions.6 This traditional attitude, so this argument runs, was also
expressed in the new managerial rationalities deployed in the technologically advanced industries of the “second industrial revolution,” which
drew on “preindustrial” bureaucratic practices and feudal hierarchies,7
and in employer yearnings for a corporatist order of occupational
“estates,” which derived from a speci‹cally German tradition of romantic
“antimodernism” that rejected modern “liberal, secular, and industrial
civilization” or “conservative feudal value orientations” of small retailers,
artisans, and industrialists from domestic heavy industry who sought protection from the competitive pressures of a modern capitalist system.8
From this perspective, paternalist and “corporatist-authoritarian” coal
and steel barons sti›ed the budding prospects of “capitalist democracy” in
the Wilhelmine era; contributed to the “willful, planned undermining of
the sociopolitical compromises . . . of the Weimar Republic”; and helped
to pave the way for the antimodernist, authoritarian appeal of National
Socialism during the late 1920s and early 1930s.9
During the 1980s, German historians decisively challenged this perspective on the preindustrial attitudes and behaviors of employers and
have since emphasized the “modernity” of industrial relations and the economic rationality of paternalist and corporatist labor policies from the late
nineteenth and twentieth centuries.10 Geoff Eley and David Crew were the
‹rst to debunk systematically the implicit teleologies of the Sonderweg thesis in relation to employers like Stumm and Krupp, especially the a priori
normative assumption that employers in modern capitalism would necessarily come to accept the bene‹ts of trade unions and social partnership.
They argue that industrial paternalism is best understood as a common
and instrumental “way of controlling labor costs by preventing workers
from organizing and striking”; maintaining a compliant labor force by
providing social bene‹ts and housing, particularly in regions lacking
urban amenities and infrastructure; and preempting state welfare and regulatory intervention into the industrial workplace and their associated
restrictions on employer prerogative.11 In this context, according to Eley,
the paternalist organization of factory production accorded with a historically “speci‹c form of capitalist rationality” that was “immanent to the

6

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

monopoly phase of German capitalism”; it was thus a product not of a
“bygone feudal era” but of a “set of relations generated by capitalism
itself” during the Wilhelmine era.12 Subsequently, historians have stressed
the “rational market calculation” that inspired paternalist company welfare schemes and antiunion measures and the basic continuity of paternalist policies in heavy industry from the nineteenth century to the Nazi era.13
Mary Nolan’s major study of industrial rationalization during the Weimar
era has similarly emphasized the economic function of right-wing corporatist visions of “factory community” and efforts to “engineer” an obedient, antiunion “new worker.” If these initiatives were “archaic” or “not the
most modern,” Nolan argues, they nevertheless served the economic interests of employers by promoting “productivity and pro‹tability.”14
This study critically interrogates this emphasis on the continuities of
work relations and production regimes in German heavy industry from
the Kaiserreich to the Third Reich, by means of a case study of discourses
about work and social order in the industrial Saar, the focus of Max
Weber’s critique and a common reference point for much subsequent
social-historical interpretation. In an attempt to make sense of the new
vocabulary of Tille and Leidig and of the wider assumptions that informed
their statements at the Mannheim conference, it identi‹es an important
discontinuity in industrial discourses or ideologies of workplace and social
organization during the Wilhelmine era: namely, the shift from a paternalist discourse of work and social relations, structured in a moralizing and
gendered metaphor of a factory “family” and anchored in rigid work rules
and extensive company social programs, to a corporatist discourse of
industrial social organization, which linked a bioracial schema of technocratic management to a wider vision of sociopolitical order based on representation by occupational groups or “productive estates” (Berufsstände). As this study demonstrates, this corporatist discourse framed a
new and forward-looking authoritarian understanding of industrial-capitalist society, an understanding that converged with core elements in the
ideological con‹gurations of the radical Right in late Wilhelmine Germany and anticipated subsequent discourses about industrial work and
social organization under National Socialism.
In view of its broader scope and relevance, therefore, this study of
Saar factory regimes and political cultures enters into recent historiographical debates over the onset of “modernity” and the generative contexts of right-wing ideologies of work and social order in Wilhelmine Germany. The social science historians understood employer discourse and

Introduction

labor relations in heavy industry in terms of the continuity of “preindustrial” traditions, and revisionist critics interpret them in relation to the
continuity of capitalist imperatives and rationalities. This study offers a
cultural-historical reading of multiple and competing industrial discourses—including paternalism, social Catholicism, Protestant-liberal
reform, social democracy, and corporatism—and their historically speci‹c
productivity, that is, their varying capacity to shape work relations and
production regimes in Saar heavy industry. In this way, it offers two challenges to existing historiographical interpretations of employer ideology in
German heavy industry. First, in response to arguments about either the
“feudal” nature or strictly economic logic of paternalist labor relations,
which have focused on ‹gures like Stumm and Krupp in particular, this
study seeks to demonstrate the bourgeois character of company paternalism as both a rational way to conceptualize and organize capitalist production and a moralizing discourse about workers’ comportment and
familial order. Second, its focus on the rise of corporatist schemes of
industrial and social order not only emphasizes an important transformation of heavy industrial labor policy and workplace organization during
the late Wilhelmine era; it also calls attention to the generative ideological
context and emergence of right-wing constructions of the economic “modern” in German heavy industry: namely, the increasing penetration of
technocratic assumptions, scienti‹c design, and racist intentions within
managerial thought and practice; the greater reliance on impersonal
norms and internalized disciplinary technologies, rather than overt managerial injunctions, in the regulation of factory labor; and the turn to
wider schemes of corporatist social reorganization in response to organized con›ict over the shape of the industrial workplace, more comprehensive forms of state labor regulation and social policy, and global economic competition.15
In this way, this study identi‹es a set of historical articulations
revealed in the prewar activities of industrialists from Saar and other German locations, with important consequences for German history. It
reveals connections between capitalist managerial practices, technocratic
models of workplace organization, comprehensive forms of collective
industrial interest representation, and antidemocratic and racist corporatist schemes of sociopolitical order that were forged in the ideological
common ground between important sectors of German heavy industry
and the radical Right on the eve of war in 1914. These schemes were disseminated more broadly during the Weimar era and ultimately taken up

8

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

and rearticulated by the National Socialists during the 1930s. In exploring
these broader consequences, therefore, this study attempts to reinvigorate
the rather dormant efforts to explore the historical genealogies of Nazism
in relation to industrial con›ict, employer politics, and the development of
industrial capitalism in Germany after 1890.
Debates over the connections between heavy industry and the German Right and between capitalism and Nazism were vibrant from the late
1960s to the 1980s, but interest in historical genealogies of this kind has
been muted by two historiographical trends during the last two decades.
The ‹rst is the general reluctance of social and cultural historians since the
1980s to formulate explicit arguments about the causal connections
between the politics and labor policies of German heavy industry and the
political Right during the late Wilhelmine period, the Weimar Republic,
and the Third Reich, in the wake of the successful critique of the Sonderweg thesis. For the most part, they have not gone beyond emphasizing the
role of industrialists in undermining the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic, identifying the similarities between Weimar-era managerial strategies
focused on the “factory community” (Werksgemeinschaft) and Nazi labor
policies during the 1930s, or rede‹ning fascist industrial policy as part of a
generalized cultural “crisis of modernity.”16
The second historiographical trend has involved the gradual acceptance of the “primacy of politics” thesis, which has encouraged interpretations of the collapse of Weimar, the rise of National Socialism, and histories of the Third Reich that no longer assign causal signi‹cance to labor
and class relations, employer politics, and capitalism. The most in›uential
formulation of this thesis came from Tim Mason, who argued as early as
1966 that Nazi leaders “broke the economic and political supremacy of
heavy industry” by means of political decisions about rearmament and
state intervention into the economy; became “independent of the in›uence
of the economic ruling classes” and even devised policies that “ran contrary to” the interests of those classes; and prevented industrialists and
their representatives from having any “decisive” in›uence on Nazi foreign
diplomacy, war aims, and efforts to create a “new imperial order in
Europe.”17 Studies of individual German ‹rms and “businessmen” during
the Weimar and Nazi eras have since portrayed the majority of industrialists as opponents of Nazism, as ineffectual political actors who were powerless to in›uence events leading to the collapse of the Weimar Republic
and the rise of the Nazis, or as unethical businessmen opportunistically
and self-interestedly, rather than ideologically, complicit in the social and

Introduction

9

economic policies of the Third Reich.18 General analyses of the dirigiste
“Nazi economy” also tend to downplay the signi‹cance of the private sector and capitalist developments to the fate of the Nazi regime, and some
even emphasize what they regard as the fundamental contractions between
the “Nazi economy” and capitalism.19 Only very recently have historians
once again begun to acknowledge the apparent “congruity of interests
between state and economy,” the “room for independent activity” (Betätigungsspielräume) left to German industrialists during the Third Reich, and
the disturbing conjunction of racial and economic imperatives in the Nazi
genocide.20
This study will respond to these two larger historiographical trends as
it attempts to rethink the historical connections between industrial class
relations, employer discourses, and right-wing politics in the genealogies
of Nazism. It will do so by drawing on the theoretical frameworks of cultural theory and the insights of the “cultural turn” in labor history in order
to explore the changing ideological discourses about work and sociopolitical order in the prewar Saar region. In particular, this study will draw
attention to the conditions of emergence of the racially charged corporatist project in Saar and German heavy industry and its subsequent connections to the racist labor policies and wider corporatist social imaginary
of the National Socialists in the 1930s.

The Cultural Turn and Ideological Discourse
The linguistic or cultural turn has emerged from a wide variety of often
divergent theoretical developments across the human sciences during the
last two decades, including Gramscian Marxism, women’s history and
feminist theory, cultural anthropology, cultural studies, historical sociology, literary deconstruction, and poststructuralist philosophy. In a highly
overdetermined way, it produced a critique of the “materialist model of
social determination,” which treats political languages as the more or less
entailed outcomes of autonomous material-economic processes, and
turned instead to analysis of the constitutive role of the discourses, languages or representations of labor, the meanings of work, market cultures,
and political factors in the very formation of economic order, factory
organization, workplace struggles, labor movements, and processes of
class formation.21 In German historiography, the cultural turn arrived
belatedly, via feminist history and “the history of everyday life” (Alltags-

geschichte).22 But during the last ten years, it has inspired numerous studies of working-class formation, the political languages of workers, regionally varied production regimes or “industrial orders,” the “micropractices” of factory production, and the factory as a “‹eld of action”
(Handlungsfeld). These studies emphasize the cultural or discursive dimensions of economic practices and social relations during the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.23
Nevertheless, this emphasis on the constitutive role of discourse has
been largely absent in debates among German historians over the meanings and import of industrial paternalism and corporatism and the relations between ideology and the economy from the Kaiserreich to the Third
Reich. Despite their fundamental and productive differences, social science historians and their critics who study industrial relations and
employer politics during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
share certain analytical claims and ontological assumptions about the
binary relationship between language or discourse and material reality:
they tend to treat languages as relatively ‹xed systems of meaning that
(should) re›ect underlying or extralinguistic economic conditions or social
structures. In this way, they interpret the meaning of employer discourse
in terms of the extent to which it “rationally” corresponds with the general
trajectory of capitalist industrialization, understood as an objective material process occurring outside the realm of representational practice or language. This kind of approach neglects the historical productivity or effectivity of discourse and imputes an intrinsic logic to economic and social
development, which calls forth cultural or ideological responses; it thereby
measures the actions and languages of historical actors in speci‹c “social
settings” against an “endogenous directionality or a priori de‹nition of
rational action” and thought.24
By contrast, recognizing the different and competing languages of
industrial social order in the Saar, this study draws on the insights produced in discussions about discourse and ideology within Gramscian cultural studies, which treat discourse as a social activity and thus recognize
its historical productivity and variability.25 In the wake of Althusser’s theory of ideology and Bakhtin’s re›ections on “dialogism,” practitioners of
cultural studies proposed a de‹nition of ideological discourse as a historically evolved and socially organized ensemble of material signifying practices—a “connotative ‹eld of reference” that interpellates subjects and
de‹nes their relation to social order.26 This de‹nition offers a number of
advantages for this study of labor relations and industrial politics. First,

Introduction

by coupling the term ideology to the term discourse, this de‹nition draws
attention to the differential workings of power in language and the hierarchical relations between discourses in different historical and social settings.27 Second, it points to the relational or “dialogical” dimensions of
discourses, their necessary orientation toward and implication in other
discourses. In these ways, this de‹nition offers a useful way of analyzing
the historical dynamics of discursive articulation—understood here in
terms of both expression in language and connection (or linkage) between
linguistic elements—as the ongoing and contingent process of hegemonic
struggle and repositioning that takes place within and between discourses
as they seek to de‹ne subjects and order the social world.28
Third, this approach permits analysis of the ways in which ideological
discourses articulate to other material practices and institutions in
response to both previous social-historical and recent cultural-historical
paradigms. If social historians and many cultural historians still reify conceptual distinctions between the “material” and the “discursive” and
thereby fail to interrogate the constitutive role of discourse in the very creation of the “economic structures” of “capitalist development,” other cultural historians attempt to subsume all material practices and institutions
into their de‹nition of discourse without distinguishing between what are
more usefully understood analytically as different dimensions of social
life.29 They do so by insisting, with Joan Scott, that there is no “opposition
between material life and political thought” and by then proceeding to
examine published texts as instantiations of discourse.30 But this kind of
approach cannot fully explain two aspects of ideological discourse crucial
for the historian of industrial class relations in Germany in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries: namely, why some discourses about industrial work and social order became dominant while others remained subordinate or even disappeared in particular historical eras or conjunctures,
as well as how such discourses came into being and were transformed over
time.31 To understand these aspects of paternalism and corporatism in the
Saar, this study relies on an analytical distinction between discourses and
other material practices and recognizes the imperative to examine their
necessary interarticulations in any lived social context. It proposes that the
signifying power of an ideological discourse is best understood in terms of
both its connotative resonances and its materialization in other social
practices and institutions.
This study therefore questions assumptions about the semantic ‹xity
and logical coherence of ideological discourses over time and ‹xed onto-

12

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

logical distinctions between the economic and the ideological. Following
Stuart Hall, it argues that our interpretations of ideological discourses
about work and social order, particularly the meanings of Saar paternalism and corporatism, should avoid a priori assumptions about their necessary “‘logics’ of arrangement” and approach them instead as historically
contingent formations whose connotative references and principles of
articulation were variable. From this perspective, rather than identifying
stable discourses and their long-term semantic unities, it makes more sense
to explore how different linguistic “elements come, under certain conditions, to cohere together within a discourse” and “how they do or do not
become articulated, at speci‹c conjunctures, to certain political subjects”
and institutional forms.32 To suggest that discourses, as modes of social
activity, are made in the course of social struggles and therefore undergo
processes of “modi‹cation and development” over time is not to claim
that they are ephemeral or permanently in ›ux.33 Rather, this study argues
that precisely the extent to which certain discourses became articulated to
other social practices secured their connotative power and allowed them to
become structurally and “materially effective” in the Saar in ways that
other discourses were not. It thereby proposes a model of cultural historical practice that attempts to analyze social and political change in the Saar
by tracing dynamic and mutually determining relations between discourses and other practices and domains of social life over time: that is, the
historical processes by which a dominant paternalist discourse about economic and social order was forged in practices of speech and writing;
materialized in social relations, public institutions, and built environments
in ways that set the main parameters for political-ideological struggle in
the region; subsequently challenged by alternative discourses about work
and social order; and ultimately supplemented and replaced by a new corporatist discourse with its own semantic articulations and range of material connections and effectivities during the prewar decade.

The Public Sphere and the State
A wider focus of this kind requires paying attention to what Bakhtin
referred to as the “social life” of discourses—in this case, their articulations and deployments across a range of sites, which go far beyond the
industrial workplace and into the translocal “public sphere” and the agencies of the imperial German state.34 This study explores the formation of

Introduction

13

ideological discourses about work in a wide range of texts and institutions—including factory work rules; management circulars; workplace rituals; company brochures; and the statutes, speeches, meeting minutes, and
memoranda produced by voluntary associations, city and town councils,
social reform organizations, and trade unions—as well as the everyday
activities, organizational structures, social relations, and modes of political deliberation that characterized the industrial workplace, social clubs
and voluntary associations, local governmental bodies, and political organizations across the Saar region. In addition, it examines the role of the
state—as a locus and framework of workplace regulation and social welfare and a repository of legal-constitutional guarantees of political
rights—in the organization of work and the modalities of politics in the
Saar. It thus explores the transformation of factory regimes and relations
of class hegemony in the Saar in the complex interplay between the arenas
of the industrial workplace, the public sphere, and the state. This perspective emerges from two sets of debates related to Jürgen Habermas’s theory
of the public sphere and the role and function of the German state.
Historians have increasingly been drawn to Habermas’s theory of the
bourgeois public sphere in order to explore vital and once neglected forms
and arenas of political activity and association, outside of the domains of
the state and economy, from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. In
the process, they have critically but sympathetically challenged Habermas’s idealized theorization of the bourgeois public sphere—especially its
normative investment in a domain, characterized by universal access, of
self-correcting rational-critical discourse beyond or outside of politics—
and proposed its rede‹nition as, in Geoff Eley’s words, “the structured setting where cultural and ideological contest or negotiation among a variety
of publics takes place.”35 This important reworking of the public sphere as
a plural domain, or set of multiple and interconnecting public spheres in
which various social groups articulate identities and stake political claims,
registers both the historically speci‹c exclusivity of the bourgeois public
sphere and its democratic possibilities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.36 This study will similarly examine the formations of Öffentlichkeit
across the cities and small towns of the Saar as the crucial arenas in which
the organization of work and the balance of social forces in the Saar were
secured but also contested by Saar workers. It thus enters into a sustained
critical engagement with production-centered studies in labor history by
relocating the struggle over labor relations and social order to the arenas
of the public sphere.

14

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Yet these revisions to Habermas’s theory tend to treat the public
sphere as a self-contained and even social space (to which historical actors
attempt to gain access) and thus to obscure the extent to which
Öffentlichkeit was structured in relations of social hierarchy and economic
inequality in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Even those
studies attuned to the uphill struggle of subordinate groups seeking access
to “public” debate have not fully appreciated the inequalities and limitations intrinsic to the bourgeois public sphere, its constitutive (not incidental) relation to the “material sphere of everyday life, the social conditions
of production” and reproduction.37 By contrast, this study pays attention
to the material and social-structural parameters of the public sphere: the
matter of who owned or controlled the principal media of public communication and who was allowed to participate in its deliberations, as well as
the processes by which hegemonic de‹nitions of Öffentlichkeit became
embodied in certain kinds of institutions, deliberative routines, and discursive norms. This emphasis is vital for any analysis of public life in a
region where the owners and directors of heavy industrial concerns, ‹gures
like Stumm in particular, deployed their considerable economic and ‹nancial power to curb or even silence the expression of oppositional or alternative speech and activity.
Moreover, these reworkings of Habermas’s theory generally adhere
to a social or “spatial” model of the public sphere, as a domain of institutions and organizations, which tends to overlook a crucial second
de‹nition of Öffentlichkeit: the collective subject or “public” forged in
political debate. As Harold Mah perceptively argues, they have neglected
analysis of the process by which the multiple voices of political life are
transformed into a “phantasmatic” unity, the ‹ction of a uni‹ed public.
This kind of analysis would refocus our attention on the central discursive
strategy of legitimation intrinsic to the bourgeois public sphere: namely,
the claim to speak in the name of “the public.” When political actors
invoke the public as collective subject in this way, they presume not the
copresence of multiple subjects and rationalities in formation but the fantasy of an already existing, unitary mass subject in possession of universal
reason.38 Accordingly, this study examines the public sphere in the Saar
not as a neutral, independent domain of public reason but as a highly contested ideological construction, not only forged in struggles over the public as a social domain, the con›ict between employers and workers over the
formation of new associations, the renting of meeting halls, and the right
to speak publicly, but also wrought in debates over who counted as “the

Introduction

15

public” and what the public could be said to authorize. It examines
thereby the actual references to and the struggle over the meaning of the
term Öffentlichkeit in the Saar during the Wilhelmine period. In this context, the public sphere emerged as a complex and often contradictory
“cross-citational ‹eld” of discursive interaction, a general “criterion” of
openness, and a collective political subject, toward which employers,
social reformers, state of‹cials, and many workers oriented themselves
and through which the terms and conditions of industrial work and the
shape of labor relations were contested in the Saar after 1890.39
Finally, by contrast with Habermas’s in›uential treatment of the
bourgeois public sphere as a discrete domain of discursive interaction, this
study explores the complex and generative interconnections between the
industrial workplace, the public sphere, and the imperial German state.40
This requires drawing on recent developments in state theory in relation to
German historiography on the Kaiserreich. German historians, like
Habermas, have long treated the state as a discrete, unitary, autonomous,
and overwhelmingly repressive entity, composed of an identi‹able set of
institutions and actors, whose concerns about governance and “policing”
extend back to the late medieval and early modern periods and constituted
the premodern core of the antidemocratic Wilhelmine state. Drawing on
the Marxist theory of Nicos Poulantzas, Göran Therborn, and Bob Jessop, Geoff Eley has questioned this interpretation of German “backwardness” and has sought to rede‹ne the imperial German state in terms of its
relative “autonomy” in relation to social groups, its particular organization as the “outcome of much wider political struggles,” and its status as
both an “institutional complex” and “permeable arena in which contending social and political forces interact.”41 This perspective has informed
the important recent studies of George Steinmetz on the welfare state and
Kathleen Canning on labor legislation in imperial Germany, both of
which have moved decisively away from assumptions about the German
state as a long-standing autonomous and homogeneous entity, toward
analysis of its heterogeneous structure as an outcome of contingent historical processes.42
Recent theoretical discussion even more comprehensively challenges
analysis of the state that presupposes its ontological essence as a “freestanding” power that is separate from other domains of social life and subject to various forms of seizure and deployment and that intervenes in
society or economy from outside. Poulantzas de‹nes the “institutional
materiality” of any capitalist state as the outcome of a historically contin-

16

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

gent and “speci‹c material condensation of a relationship of forces among
classes and class fractions,” as a “strategic ‹eld and process of interconnecting power networks,” including the organization of “processes of
thought” in the context of state discourse.43 In a more explicitly Foucaultian formulation, Timothy Mitchell argues that the presence of the state
derives from the “complex of social practices” that constitute modern
forms of “governmentality”—the dispersed political rationalities and disciplinary technologies that are deployed locally “around particular [social]
issues,” ranging from crime to public health to working-class radicalism,
and institutionalized in prisons, clinics, schools, asylums, workhouses,
welfare programs, and factories. From this perspective, the modern state
emerges as a “structural effect,” which appears to be a discrete entity
removed from other realms of economic and social life. The boundary separating the state and other realms of economic and social life should be
viewed not as a “boundary between two discrete entities but as a line
drawn internally, within the network of institutional mechanisms through
which a social and political order is maintained.”44 Consequently, the state
is integral to the formation of workplace regimes, markets, modes of regulation and “governance,” and regimes of capital accumulation that structure economic practices; it is not a freestanding body that intervenes in
their “normal” workings from outside.45 This cultural turn in state theory
offers important insights for the study of political culture in the Saar
region, where the state owned most of the coal mines, shaped the structures of industrial work by means of welfare and regulatory policy, and
provided the legal frameworks for public political activity. It also allows
new perspectives on the transition from paternalism to corporatism during
the decade before 1914 and on the connections between state (re)formation
and the development of corporatist ideological projects in Germany after
1914.

The Saar Region
The presence of the state, large-scale manufacturing, and a regional public
sphere dominated by some of Germany’s most powerful industrialists suggest the possibility of exploring developments in the Saar as a point of
departure for understanding some of the wider social and political transformations of imperial Germany and early twentieth-century Europe. The
Saar, one of Germany’s leading industrial regions, witnessed dramatic

Introduction

17

increases in the size and output of its coal mining, iron and steel production, and glass manufacturing after 1870. Its concentration of large-scale
industry, increasingly expanding unskilled and semiskilled labor forces,
paternalist disciplinary and social policy regimes, and managerial and
organizational changes after 1900 had parallels in other parts of Germany
and Europe, but the political-cultural trajectory of employer politics in the
Saar region during the prewar decade was also distinctive in its systematic
elaboration and precocious development. In this way, it anticipated subsequent corporatist political-economic realignments in the rest of Germany
and Europe during the early twentieth century.
The Saar Valley was once an isolated agrarian enclave, ruled by the
Count of Nassau-Saarbrücken before the French invasion and occupation
from 1792 to 1814. After the defeat of Napoleon, it was divided between
Prussia and Bavaria, though the bulk of the coal‹elds went to Prussia. The
Prussian state took over administration of nearly all Saar mines, which
were placed under the direction of the Prussian Mining Of‹ce (Bergwerksdirektion). That of‹ce, located in Saarbrücken, was subordinated to the
Upper Prussian Mining Administration (Oberbergamt) in Bonn and ultimately responsible to the Prussian Ministry of Public Works (Ministerium
für öffentliche Arbeiten) in Berlin. If the mining industry nearly collapsed
from the loss of French markets after 1815, the creation of the German
Customs Union in 1834 opened up southern markets for Saar coal and led
to a dramatic increase of coal output from the region. This occurred after
the 1840s, when the Mining Of‹ce turned to a policy of labor recruitment
that attracted increasing numbers of peasant migrants from the surrounding region, but especially after the 1850s and 1860s, when state of‹cials
introduced a series of economic reforms that removed restrictions on managerial prerogative and the “free” movement of labor, including the miners’ traditional privileges and corporate or “estate” status.46 In 1875, the
Prussian Mining Of‹ce was the largest industrial enterprise in the region
and employed nearly 23,000 miners. That ‹gure rose to 30,376 in 1890 and
to 42,418 in 1900. By 1910, its twelve “inspectorates” or collieries employed
53,055 miners. The Mining Of‹ce’s production rose in similarly continuous fashion: in 1875, Saar mining was producing 4.5 million tons of coal
annually; in 1900, just under 9.4 million tons; and in 1910, over 10.8 million
tons.47 By 1913, when its collieries were producing 18 million tons of coal,
Saar mining constituted 8.6 percent of the coal industry in Germany.
The increasing output of the Saar mines took place within an expanding regional network of industrial concentration, involving especially the

18

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

iron and steel mills and glass and ceramics foundries, with their demand
for coke, as well as evolving regional markets in a range of industrial products. After French authorities privatized the iron and steel industry in the
early nineteenth century, ownership of the major mills passed to the bourgeois Stumm family, originally from the Hunsrück region. These mills
were located in Neunkirchen, Halberg, and Dillingen and employed only
about 1,100 workers in 1846.48 In 1852, the construction of a regional rail
network made ore from Lorraine accessible to local factories and
increased the ef‹ciency of the shipment of iron products out of the Saar,
enabling the subsequent expansion of the iron and steel industry. When
Carl Ferdinand Stumm became a codirector of the ‹rm Gebrüder Stumm
in 1858, there was only one competitor in the region, the Burbach steelworks, under Belgian and Luxembourgeois ownership. But in 1873,
another local industrial family, the Röchlings, built a steelworks in Völklingen, and by 1878, the Saar iron and steel industry employed 5,627 workers.49 In subsequent decades, despite temporary downturns, the Saar iron
and steel industry expanded dramatically: the number of workers
employed by the ‹ve main concerns—the Stumm steelworks in
Neunkirchen, the Röchling concerns in Völklingen, the Burbach steelworks in Malstatt-Burbach, the Brebach steelworks (formerly of Halberg),
and the Dillingen steelworks—rose from 11,932 in 1890 to 17,830 in 1900
and 24,943 in 1910. Overall output of raw iron increased from 105,350 tons
of raw iron in 1878 to 442,824 in 1890, 554,597 in 1900, and 1,197,688 in
1910. By 1913, the iron and steel mills in the Saar were producing 11.2 percent of all raw iron and 14.5 percent of all raw steel in Germany.50 These
developments were paralleled by the growth of a third major industry,
glass and ceramics manufacturing. In the ‹rst decade of the nineteenth
century, nearly all of the glass foundries were purchased by a handful of
bourgeois families—the Vopelius, Reppert, Wentzel, Köhl, and Wagner
families—and the ceramics industry was led by the Villeroy and Boch families, which joined their enterprises in Wallerfangen and Mettlach in 1842.
By 1860, Saar glass foundries employed 1,500 workers; these ‹gures rose to
2,500 in 1880 and 5,000 in 1906, when the largest concerns had workforces
of some 250 employees. Its overall production ‹gures never came close to
the coal and steel industries, but the Saar glass industry was responsible
for nearly one-quarter of all glass production in Germany by 1913.51
By the last third of the nineteenth century, heavy industry dominated
the social landscape of the Saar Valley. The increasing pace and scale of
industrial expansion and concentration produced larger and larger enter-

Introduction

19

prises, and the major branches of Saar heavy industry employed increasing numbers of semiskilled and unskilled laborers. Consequently, the population of the Prussian Saar rose from 176,158 in 1843 to 652,294 in 1910.52
It was concentrated in the urban industrial triangle bounded by
Neunkirchen, Saarbrücken, and Völklingen and was disproportionately
proletarian in relation to national averages. By 1909, Saarbrücken and St.
Johann merged with Malstatt-Burbach to form a single large city
[Grossstadt] with a population of just over one hundred thousand. Smaller
industrial towns like Dudweiler and Malstatt-Burbach also witnessed
rapid growth and highly mobile populations from the 1850s to 1914,
though many Saarländer lived in small to medium-sized communities of
between two thousand and thirty-two thousand inhabitants, and the
region was home to a large number of so-called worker-peasants during
this period.53 Nevertheless, by the 1870s, few inhabitants of the region
remained unaffected by the sprawling infrastructure of collieries, iron and
steel concerns, metalworking plants, and glassmaking and ceramics
foundries, as well as the communications networks (railroad, canals, and
thoroughfares), municipal institutions and services, and communities that
developed in their proximity to facilitate their operation.
These transformations helped to forge the distinctive political geography of the region, which was anchored in the local and regional dependencies of “company towns,” notable politics, and the prominence of economic and political ‹gures of national importance. The two leading
political parties of the Saar, the National Liberal Party and the Free Conservative Party, were led by local industrialist notables from the iron and
steel, glass and ceramics, machine-making, and coal industries and were
challenged only by the Center Party after the 1890s. In this context, Saar
industrialist notables attained levels of national preeminence and political
in›uence that far exceeded the relatively small geographical size of the
Saar after 1870: Stumm, a CVDI leader whose businesses extended to coal
and ore ‹elds and steelworks in Lorraine and Luxembourg, was a Free
Conservative member of the Reichstag from 1867 to 1881 and from 1889 to
1901, a member of the Prussian Landtag from 1867 to 1870 and of the
Prussian Upper House from 1882 to 1901, and a personal friend of the
kaiser; Richard Vopelius was a Free Conservative member of the Prussian
Landtag from 1876 to 1879 and from 1882 to 1903 and was chairman of the
CVDI from 1904 to 1908; and Karl Röchling, owner of the Röchling steel
concerns in Völklingen, was one of Germany’s leading industrialists, with
possessions in Lorraine, Aachen, and the Ruhr. As the leaders of regional

20

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

employer associations and as national spokesmen for German heavy
industry, Saar industrialists and their representatives were able to
in›uence the formulation of state welfare and industrial policy during the
1870s and 1880s and to set the tone for much of the proposed antisocialist
and antiunion legislation of the “Stumm era” during the middle to late
1890s.
After 1900, when new challenges from trade unions and social reformers brought on a crisis of paternalist hegemony and when local industrial
enterprises entered into a process of technical-organizational transformation, a new generation of Saar employers and industry representatives of
national prominence came to the fore. Alexander Tille, a former university
professor and assistant to the chairman of the CVDI before he took over
the Saar industry organizations in 1903, became the most proli‹c spokesmen for heavy industry in imperial Germany. Max Schlenker, Tille’s
replacement after 1912, became a leading industrial representative before
the First World War and, after 1925, the managing director of the in›uential Langnamverein (Association for the Protection of the Common Economic Interests of the Rhineland and Westphalia), the main employer
organization in the Ruhr. And Hermann Röchling, a son of Karl Röchling
and technical director of the Röchling steelworks in Völklingen after 1901,
became a leader of the national company union movement as member of
the executive council of the German League of Company Unions (Bund
Deutscher Werkvereine), leader of the German-Saarland People’s Party
(Deutsch-Saarländische Volkspartei) during the 1920s and early 1930s, and
a leading Nazi industrialist after 1936. In these capacities, Saar employers
and their representatives became the most systematic exponents of corporatist economic-social and political-constitutional change after 1908, up to
and including attacks on universal male suffrage and the parliamentary
system itself. They were thus crucial to the formulation of a new “fascist”
ideological paradigm of industrial social order, with important consequences for the subsequent histories of industrial relations and political
culture during the Weimar and Nazi eras.

chapter 1

Company Paternalism in the
Industrial Saar

On 24 April 1890, workers of the Wendel coking plant in Hirschbach went
on strike in an effort to secure wage increases, changes to the company
pension and sickness fund, an eight-hour shift for workers at the blast furnace, and ten-hour shifts for all others. One week later, Dr. Hallwachs, the
factory director, signaled his company’s refusal to meet the demands or
even to bargain with the workers: “A wage increase will not be granted.
Whoever does not want to work can leave, but you will never work at this
factory again. No Kaiser or king can help you here, for here we are the
masters.”1 Hallwachs’s dismissal of all authority beyond his own and that
of his managers and his reference to the employers as “masters” of the factory were not products of the immediate circumstances of the labor dispute in Hirschbach during the spring of 1890. Rather, they expressed a set
of understandings about employer prerogative and invoked a wider discourse about workplace relations that were common throughout the Saar
and the industrial regions of Germany and Europe in the nineteenth century—a discourse that was variously institutionalized in the disciplinary
codes, social provisions, and rituals that made up the paternalist factory
regime in Saar mining, iron and steel production, and glass and ceramics
manufacturing.2
This paternalist regime—the “Stumm system”—in Saar heavy industry is the subject of this chapter. German historians have interpreted this
model as either a static preindustrial holdover or an entailed expression of
underlying economic conditions and imperatives. This chapter examines
paternalism as a historically determinate discourse about work relations
21

22

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

and moral order, which was materialized in a conjuncturally speci‹c set of
factory institutions and managerial practices. It interprets the actual terms
and propositions of paternalist discourse, its explicit claims and implicit
assumptions, in order to demonstrate the ways it combined economically
liberal de‹nitions of the private labor contract and employer prerogative
with moralizing and gendered understandings of work and the factory
“family.”3 This chapter then examines the ways in which paternalist discourse was articulated to multiple forms of business ownership, a certain
model of workplace discipline and company social welfare, a set of company rituals, and wider institutions of public authority that were entirely
“rational” and appropriate to their times, particularly when they are compared with paternalist factory regimes in other regions of Germany and
Europe.
In the ‹nal section, this chapter argues that the factory paternalism of
Stumm and other Saar employers became a model for the imperial German welfare state of the 1870s to the 1880s. The latter differed from the
other European welfare and regulatory measures in terms of its predominant focus on social insurance over state inspection and direct oversight, a
divergence that was in large part due to the in›uence of Saar and other
German industrialists in the making of the early welfare state. Rather than
treating paternalism as an originary or self-contained managerial discourse derived from preindustrial values or from a managerial logic immanent to the monopoly phase of German capitalism, this chapter explores
the ways in which the “Stumm system” was elaborated and sustained in
historically contingent discursive-political ‹elds and the speci‹c institutional matrices of industrial organization and state formation in the latter
half of the nineteenth century.

Saar Paternalism and Political Economy
Until very recently, the historiographical debate over industrial paternalism in Germany had been curiously silent about the actual terms and
propositions of paternalism as a discourse and their articulations in managerial practices—that is, the complex of workplace discipline and social
provision that constituted the paternalist factory regime. German historians committed to the preindustrial thesis have ignored Stumm’s own selfdescription as a “modern man,”4 while those concerned to show how
paternalist ideas were compatible with the extralinguistic forces of monop-

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

23

oly capitalism have overlooked the productivity of paternalist discourse.
But the economic terms and propositions of Saar paternalism were more
than just responses to the evolving and autonomous relations and institutions of the industrial workplace in the monopoly phase of German capitalism; they were meaningful, productive, and highly mobile elements,
subject to various kinds of articulatory practice during the imperial era.
When read for their speci‹c meanings in this way, it is clear that the economic dimensions of paternalist discourse in the Saar derived not from
preindustrial or archaic values but from the implicit assumptions and
overt commitments of bourgeois political economy and that they helped to
shape the industrial workplace in the Saar.
Despite their presumptive invasiveness, Stumm often defended his
managerial practices from the perspectives of bourgeois political economy
and even rejected the “feudal” label given to him by his political opponents. In his numerous appearances from the 1860s on, before the Reichstag of the North German Confederation, the Prussian Upper House, the
German Reichstag, local political meetings, and ceremonies with his own
workers in Neunkirchen, Stumm described his work rules and welfare provisions in terms of bourgeois-liberal assumptions about the duties and
responsibilities of the individual, the “free labor contract,” and the economic imperatives and interests of modern industrial society.5 He
embraced the bourgeois ethos of self-determination and individualism,
not only in his antitheoretical rejection of “book learning” (Bücherweisheit) in favor of a model of the employer who draws from the “world
of practical life experience,” but also in his description of the central
dimension of the paternalist factory regime: its foundation in the “personal relationship between employer and worker.”6 The latter was understood in part as a relationship between two bargaining and self-interested
individuals, partners in a negotiated “wage contract,” in which employer
and employee entered into an agreement over the terms and conditions of
employment. This meant the employer’s acceptance of workers as full “citizens” operating under the conditions of legal equality. In response to
socialist claims that industrial workers had been “degraded to the level of
a fourth estate,” for example, Stumm insisted before his own workforce in
1895, “The working class [Arbeiterschaft] today is completely equal to all
other categories of citizens, and I will never agree that the worker . . . possesses less value than a Kommerzienrat or a government minister.” Moreover, he argued that because the hierarchy of positions in a factory was
characterized by a wide range of job titles, tasks could not be divided into

24

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

the two simple categories of employers and workers. “‘Self-reliance is the
name of the game’ [Selbst ist der Mann] is the principle of every diligent
worker,” Stumm maintained, arguing that this principle would get the
worker “the furthest in relation to the employer.”7 This view corresponded
with an understanding that limited the role of the state in the industrial
workplace and that bore some traces of the “night watchman state” of
economic liberalism. During the Reichstag debate over the new Industrial
Code Bill in 1890, Stumm explicitly de‹ned the state as a guarantor of the
“freedom of the wage contract”; its role was to defend the allegedly natural relations of authority that obtained in civil society.
In my view the state should not intervene directly or in a partisan way
in these relationships, and at the very least it may not undermine
authority where authority is present. The state must value and protect
the authority of the employer just as much as it does the authority of
its own organs, and those of the churches and the schools. Naturally,
I ‹nd it completely appropriate that the state enacts measures in order
to prevent the misuse of this authority; for the misuse of authority
damages authority in general.8
Stumm therefore objected to attempts by the state to restrict employer
control over employee behavior outside of the factory and to regulate the
degree of penalties employers could impose on workers as well as factory
work rules in general: “the legislator has nothing to say about the content
of the factory work code . . . that must be left to the agreement between
worker and employer.” Such interference violated a “fundamental principle” of the “free labor contract”: the right of workers and employers to
agree on the terms of employment freely and independently.9 Like many
nineteenth-century political economists and despite his willingness routinely to call on the state to crush independent labor organizations, Stumm
ignored the glaring asymmetry of power and conditions of existence
between the wealthy industrialist and the wage earner, whose reliance on
paid employment for survival could not simply be reduced to a “choice”
between entering into a “wage contract” or not.
These claims were deemed compatible with the most far-reaching disciplinary rules of the paternalist factory regime. It was on the basis of the
need for reliable, diligent labor in the factory that Stumm defended his
practice of penalizing workers at his steelworks (especially by means of
workplace ‹nes) for civil infractions taking place outside of work. In 1891,

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

25

he insisted that “the behavior of workers in and outside of the factory
absolutely cannot be separated from each other.”
A worker who dedicates himself to dissolute moral conduct outside
the factory will also not be able to function at the workplace. If he or
a foreman runs a store or a business, then connections will necessarily
be established between foreman and workers that would have some
in›uence on their relationship in the factory to the disadvantage of
other workers. If workers frivolously ‹le charges in court, say,
because their wives have insulted one another, then it will be impossible to prevent the con›ict and quarrel from entering the factory. If
half-ripe lads, who do not earn suf‹cient wages, get married prematurely and bring children into the world, then they will not be in a
position to support and rear the latter, and they will lose the necessary
strength and enthusiasm to do their work. Whoever does not followed the principle “honesty is the best policy” in his private life will
not be able to resist the temptation to appropriate valuable materials,
which lie about unlocked in the factory.10
In this sense, Stumm understood his factory work rules and disciplinary
regime as a means “to develop” each employee into “a competent and
well-behaved worker.”11 This kind of discipline, Stumm argued in 1898,
was “absolutely necessary in a rational enterprise that is supposed to
remain competitive.”12 Moreover, his unabashed commitment to excluding trade unions from his steelworks and attacking local publicans even
for making their rooms available to trade unions in Neunkirchen derived
from his rejection of collective negotiations of any kind. The association of
workers, in that sense, violated the “freedom” of the individual and subverted the “personal relationship” between employer and employee.
Stumm vehemently opposed social democracy not only for its revolutionary doctrine and its variously “immoral” commitments—including its
opposition to the bourgeois family and marriage, the churches, the monarchy, and state authority—but also for the ways its supporters brought
their “tyranny” to workers.13 In a curious rhetorical inversion, he claimed
that the real threat to the “freedom” of workers was not excessive paternalist control over workers’ lives, anchored in the asymmetry of social
power between employer and employee, but the coercive threats to a
worker’s “body and life” in the efforts of independent trade union “agitators” and Social Democratic “seducers of workers” to organize and mobi-

26

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

lize workers for industrial actions and collective bargaining. When a
worker joined such a “combative organization,” he was brought under the
spell of “outside agitators” who “destroyed his independence.”14 By 1898,
Stumm was celebrating “American industry”—the classic signi‹er of the
economic modern for contemporaries and subsequent scholars—for its
ef‹ciency, productivity, and growing in›uence over world markets at the
expense of the British; he attributed this superiority mainly to the fact that
American employers had achieved “mastery” over the trade unions.15
Finally, as Stumm maintained in his speeches before the Reichstag in 1890,
paternalist control over the lives of workers off the job, including the infamous marriage clause at the Neunkirchen steelworks, was authorized not
by “feudal” privilege or birthright but in part by the “free wage contract”
itself, which contained these rules and allowed the worker to accept them
or not. This, according to Stumm, was a coercion-free exchange: “If a
worker does not comply with this arrangement [i.e., the marriage clause],
he will not be penalized; rather, I would pose a question like: do you want
to submit to the rules that I have presented to you or do you want to give
up this job? This has nothing to do with punishment.”16
The social provisions associated with the paternalist factory regime,
from bonuses to company housing, were framed by a similar capitalist
logic. Stumm and other Saar industrialists never made a secret of the
“rational” economic motivations behind their extensive bene‹ts and welfare programs. In their main press organ, the Saarbrücker Gewerbeblatt,
they described the “patriarchal . . . welfare provisions” of local heavy
industry as a means for promoting the “good behavior” of workers and
their “long-term competence” and for reducing labor turnover and accidents at the workplace—all of which contributed to the “prosperity of the
. . . factory.”17 In a similar way, Stumm described the importance of wage
bonuses in securing a “lasting, settled population” in order to reduce labor
mobility and to stabilize his labor force.18 This was a common motivation
behind social provisions, echoed in the statements of of‹cials at the foreign-owned Burbach steelworks and of Saar mining of‹cials, who referred
to the “purpose” of attracting a “core of workers” (Arbeiterstamm).19
Company housing and housing loans and premiums, which extended
employer prerogative most comprehensively into the everyday private
lives of workers and their families, were similarly understood as mechanisms for securing a stable workforce and for inculcating the habits of
“economic man.” According to an essay cited in the Saarbrücker Gewerbeblatt, a worker’s “property makes him thrifty and economical [haushälter-

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

27

isch],” so that “he learns to value and put to use the smallest savings for his
household.”20

The Moral Dimensions of Work and the Factory “Family”
Saar paternalism articulated other meanings that cannot be reduced to
these strictly economic concerns and ambitions. The paternalist factory
regime was also structured in a relation of moral tutelage in which work
was de‹ned by its moral properties and in which the employer or factory
director was ‹gured as the moral guardian of workers. In this context,
comprehensive work rules and welfare programs were explicitly motivated
by moral concerns and designed to attend to the moral development of
workers. Moreover, these intentions and practices were framed by a wider
paternalist vision of a factory “family,” ordered according to bourgeois
codes of sexual difference, and instantiated in the regime of discipline and
social provision. In these ways, Saar paternalism combined capitalist
rationalities with bourgeois concerns about moral and familial order in an
ideological discourse capable of interarticulating diverse—though not
incompatible—assumptions and intentions.
Saar employers routinely invoked morality and moral concerns in
their dealings with workers and wrote moral concerns directly into their
factory work rules, which were designed to inculcate in workers what local
employers de‹ned as respectable and moral behavior. Stumm explicitly
described his relationship to his workers as one of moral tutelage, motivated by his “moral sense of duty” and “Christian conviction.” He
believed that the moral “education of the worker” by means of his disciplinary code, one of the “moral obligations” prescribed by his “conscience” and his “God,” was more important than the social provisions of
the paternalist regime because it had the most direct effect on the behavior
of his workers.21 Other employers shared this perspective. Toward this
end, several local ‹rms promulgated work rules that targeted employee
behavior both inside and outside of the factory. Stumm announced
bluntly in work rule 44, “Every foreman and worker will conduct himself
outside the factory in a way which corresponds to the dignity of the house
of Gebrüder Stumm; you can expect that your private behavior will always
be subject to the ‹rm’s scrutiny, and that improper conduct outside the
factory will result in termination when there is no applicable penalty in the
existing factory regulations.”22 At most large ‹rms, workers were sub-

28

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

jected to ‹nes or dismissal for drinking, sleeping, or violation of factory
discipline, but they were also punished for “violations against good
morals” and activities related to civil “disturbances” and “excesses” (e.g.,
public drunkenness; the discharge of weapons during Christening celebrations, weddings, or New Year’s parties; or resistance against police
of‹cials).23 Of‹cials of the Mining Of‹ce commanded their employees to
behave in such a way as “to bring honor to your estate and occupation,”
especially in relation their workplace superiors, and penalized miners for
various kinds of civil infractions or other “excesses,” including ‹ghting
that took place away from the collieries.24 Company of‹cials at private
Saar ‹rms also monitored other aspects of the moral lives of their workforce. At the Stumm concerns in Neunkirchen, foremen were required to
observe the drinking habits of their employees: those below forty years of
age who “appeared” to drink too much and thus represented both a moral
threat and a future ‹nancial burden on the company’s sickness fund were
immediately dismissed. The disciplinary code demanded that they report
all manner of employee “excess” taking place “outside of the factory.”25
Moreover, the rules about moral behavior, obedience, discipline, and
honor were generally enforced in all company facilities, including cafeterias, washing rooms, hospitals, the schools, swimming pools, parks, and
dormitories.26 In the case of Saar mining, the latter, which were led by wardens or “house masters” and policed by “resident elders” (Stubenältesten),
enforced strict obedience to a wide array of disciplinary and moralizing
rules: proscribed behavior included violating the 9:30 p.m. curfew, failing
to be in bed by 10:00 p.m., making loud noises, engaging in disputes,
singing “indecent songs,” and even whistling. All residents were forced to
adhere to dress codes mandating appropriate attire—all were required to
wear shirts, pants, and shoes when walking around the facilities—and, not
surprisingly, access to women was carefully regulated. Fears of illicit sexual behavior and its moral effects on the workers meant that women were
only allowed to enter the dormitories during the daytime for the purpose
of bringing food or clothing to residents.27 In general, a concern with
“morals” and respectability, in addition to workplace obedience and subordination, inspired many of the most imperious work rules, including
Stumm’s rule about workers greeting him and the similar Mining Of‹ce
rule about residents of the mining dormitories standing and removing
their caps when their superiors entered the rooms or the areas surrounding
the facilities.28
Similar kinds of moral considerations motivated the many social

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

29

bene‹ts and programs of the paternalist factory regime. Of‹cials of the
Mining Of‹ce understood the function of the miners’ Knappschaft [sickness and pension fund] especially its sponsorship of schools for children, in
terms of its role in bringing about the “moralization” of miners and their
families, and their housing and settlement policies were similarly conceived as attempts to “elevate the economic as well as the moral well-being
of the worker” into an “orderly” and “regulated lifestyle” in order to prevent the formation of a “massive and morally and politically dangerous
proletariat.”29 Stumm routinely invoked the “moral” bene‹ts associated
with his social provisions and turned them into forms of moral discipline:
they were available only to employees who demonstrated the appropriate
moral comportment; workers who violated the standards set by the ‹rm or
in general failed to maintain a “thoroughly proper lifestyle” were denied
all bonuses, favors, or other bene‹ts.30 Employers generally considered
these ambitions or intentions entirely compatible with, indeed essential to,
“rational” managerial practices, since diligent labor was predicated on
good “morals.”
This moralizing framework re›ected a bourgeois, not a “feudal,” orientation toward values and behavior. The kinds of “morals” that Saar
employers hoped to inculcate in their workers—thrift, sobriety, moderation, self-reliance, self-discipline, sense of duty, loyalty, sexual restraint
and propriety, respectability, family life, “good citizenship,” and especially a positive attitude toward work—were all part of the ensemble of
virtues and social practices associated with Bürgerlichkeit, or “bourgeois
culture,” the focus of much social-historical research on the German middle classes [Bürgertum] in the wake of the Sonderweg debates of the 1980s.31
When René von Boch spoke to his workers in 1891 during the ‹ftieth
anniversary celebration of his ceramics ‹rm in Mettlach, for example, he
talked about the exemplary qualities of past employees, emphasizing the
“fear of God, ful‹llment of one’s duty, love of work, mutual trust” as the
Villeroy & Boch “solution.”32 Later that same year, Hans Seebohm, director of the Burbach steelworks, also invoked bourgeois values during a
commemoration ceremony. Congratulating the recipients of pocket
watches for their twenty-‹ve years of service to the ‹rm, he emphasized
their “diligence and skill” but “above all” their “moral way of life” (sittlichen Lebenswandel).33 Similarly, Stumm routinely congratulated his
workers for their “good behavior, diligence, and competent performance”
on the job.34 Even his references to the military and military discipline,
which some historians have interpreted as “feudal” gestures, are best

30

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

understood in terms of the values they were meant to celebrate. When he
referred to the army as a “school for life” during a ceremony for the local
regiment in 1896, he meant to point up its role in inculcating the virtues of
“manly discipline, loyalty to the monarch, patriotism, sense of duty, and
willingness to sacri‹ce,” which the soldier “brings into bourgeois life, in
the family.”35 In other words, Stumm and other Saar employers were preoccupied with the bourgeois virtues of work and home life, rather than
military virtues per se. In this regard, Stumm’s primary concern was to elevate workers to the ranks of middle-class citizens (Bürger) in order to sustain the independent Mittelstand, that vital “link between the propertyless
and the rich.”36 From this perspective, the regime of disciplinary rules and
social provisions of Saar paternalism was understood as a way of treating
the worker not “simply like a work machine” but as a “decent and moral”
person in order to “maintain public morals”—the foundations of all
“bourgeois and state order.”37
In this bourgeois framework of assumptions and meanings, Saar
employers associated work with moral qualities and attributes. They celebrated hard work and labor discipline for their moralizing aspects: work
was considered a “means of improvement” that provided for an individual’s material needs; inculcated “values,” such as orderliness and moderation; and deterred the individual from engaging in “idle” or dissolute pursuits.38 Its opposite, “laziness,” was to be condemned or even criminalized.
Re›ecting on the “sacredness” of work and the imperative to “maintain
the desire to work,” the industry friendly Malstatt-Burbacher Zeitung, suggested, “Whoever avoids [this] most holy earthly undertaking, whoever
thereby contributes to the dissolution of all bonds of honor and morals
and the subversion of public order and morality, does not deserve the
slightest consideration or humane leniency; rather, the full force of the law
should be applied to such people.”39 In this sense, Saar employer-paternalists drew on the long-standing bourgeois representation of labor as an
honorable human pursuit, an ennobling activity that endows its practitioner with both moral and political signi‹cance.40 During ‹rm ceremonies
and dinners for the distribution of bonuses and the induction of employees
into sickness and pension funds, Saar employers routinely invoked the
“honorable” and moral aspects of diligent work and long-term service to
the company. Conversely, as discussed previously, Saar employers insisted
that what they deemed to be moral rectitude was the only solid basis for
steady, diligent labor. This was why they made few distinctions between
discipline and orderliness in the factory and moral order more generally:

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

31

Stumm maintained, “A worker who dedicates himself to dissolute moral
conduct outside the factory will also not be able to function at the workplace.”41 In this sense, Saar industrialists resisted clear distinctions
between morals, on the one hand, and strictly economic considerations, on
the other.
The most obviously bourgeois aspect of the paternalist factory
regime, however, was its gendered vision of familial order, which served as
the model for labor relations throughout the Saar from the 1860s to the
1890s. The paternalist factory regime was discursively founded on a set of
pervasive assumptions about work relations that identi‹ed the employer
as the “provider” (Brotgeber) or father ‹gure while it identi‹ed the workers as the dependents or children in the larger “family of producers”
(Arbeiterfamilie). The Free Conservative Stumm, for example, regularly
referred to himself as the “head of the larger Neunkirchen family of workers” in his role as owner of his steel factory in Neunkirchen; and the
National Liberal and Catholic René von Boch of the Villeroy & Boch
ceramics foundry praised his long-standing and “excellent family relationship” with his workers in Mettlach.42 Derived from the model of the bourgeois family, this gendered imagery served to de‹ne relations of power in
the factory: the employer, as the male head of the factory family, was
responsible for all decisions related to the terms and conditions of work.
He claimed the right to establish wage rates, work hours, and extensive
work rules without the input of workers. Similarly, he rejected independent trade unions or workers’ representatives as threats to the sanctity of
private property—an owner’s right to dispose of his property as he saw
‹t—and to the employer’s authority as “master of the house” (Herr im
Hause) or factory. Yet paternalist work relations were not based on total
domination over workers; they rested instead on an implicit (and often
explicit) understanding of reciprocal obligation and duty. Stumm
explained, “The employer should feel as though he were the head of a large
family, whose individual members have a claim on his muni‹cence so long
as they prove themselves worthy.”43
This was a comprehensive vision of industrial and social order,
anchored initially in the family-owned ‹rm involving both the factory
owner and his spouse. Well into the 1890s, Saar industrialists supported
the family-owned ‹rm as the best model for industrial organization. In an
1888 petition to the Prussian Ministry of Commerce, leaders of the Saar
Chamber of Commerce supported legislation in favor of a new kind of
“public company with limited liability” that would maintain the organiza-

32

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

tion of the “family ‹rm” even when no members of the “founding family”
were interested in the actual running of the company. According to the
petition, allowing family members to participate by means of the ownership of shares in the company had clear “economic and political advantages.”
The enterprise itself will continue to exist uninterrupted in the same
old ways. The shareholders, who are closely connected, will endeavor
to survive with great energy, even in the face of losses during bad
times, certainly with more vigor than just any other ‹rm with ‹xed
investments. Keeping the connections between the family spirit and
enduring enterprises will result in each elevating and strengthening
the other. The favorable consequences for the formation of a permanent core of workers, loyal to the ‹rm and the family, will necessarily
follow.44
In this sense, the factory “family” linked the actual familial basis of ‹rm
ownership to relations between employers and workers; it thereby
involved both the employer as father ‹gure and the employer’s wife as
“mother” in the regime of moral discipline and welfare that characterized
Saar paternalism. As the Saarbrücker Gewerbeblatt noted, “all of these
programs” and facilities were supposed to be administered “under the constant personal oversight of the boss of the ‹rm and his spouse.”45 In the
Saar, therefore, the wives of leading industrialists took part in a range of
charitable activities associated with the paternalist factory regime, including overseeing the factory schools for girls, child care initiatives, charitable
distributions, and Christmas events and activities. As the next chapter will
suggest, this activity was sponsored by the ‹rm and linked to the local
women’s association (Frauenverein), which was usually run by the wife of
a local industrialist.
Indeed, factory rituals and ceremonial provided important occasions
for the enactment of the “familial” relationship in the factory. Saar
employers extended their assumptions about the comfortable intimacy
between members of the family unit to their relations with workers; this
was part and parcel of their insistence on the fundamentally “personal”
aspect of all work relations. Regular and intimate employer-employee
contacts, institutionalized in the employer’s weekly of‹ce hours or in the
familiar setting of factory rituals and ceremonies, were designed to facilitate a harmonious “work relationship” and mutual respect and affection

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

33

between employer and employees—respect and affection that were
enforced by means of the factory work rules, which required workers to
greet management by standing and removing their caps.46 Saar ‹rms sponsored a busy schedule of factory events and rituals during which such
familial relations were regularly reinforced: these included the aforementioned ceremonies for the distribution of bonuses and the induction of
members into the company-sponsored sickness and pension funds; lavishly orchestrated visits by local and national dignitaries; holiday and
patriotic celebrations; and, most symbolically, festivities that marked
important events in the life of the factory owner and his own family (e.g.,
birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries).47 Anniversaries marking a ‹rm’s
twenty-‹fth or ‹ftieth year of operation commonly involved owners, managers, workers, and their families. Such ceremonies often began with a
midday meal (Festessen) to which the owners, company of‹cials, and a few
select workers were invited. Typically, speeches in honor of the owners
and in praise of a loyal workforce would be followed by toasts. The celebration would broaden afterward to include all workers and their families,
gathered in open areas (e.g., forest areas or the nearby mining picnic
grounds) where they were provided food, drink, and various forms of
entertainment. The latter usually involved music performed by the company-sponsored choral societies and musical bands as well as dancing,
carousels, show booths, and prize contests. The festivities often involved
the broader community; at the ‹fty-year anniversary celebration of the
Raspiller & Co. glassworks in Fenne in 1884, for example, both the factory
and town buildings were decorated with ›ags, garlands, and wreaths during the day’s festivities. Local clubs and associations also participated in
the evening festivities.48 Similarly, during the ‹fty-year anniversary celebration of the ‹rm Villeroy & Boch, which included managers, workers,
and other invited guests in a series of ceremonies and events, Boch narrated the history of the “family” ‹rm and invoked the familial relations
between employer and workers.49 These kinds of “family” activities complemented the more direct ceremonies associated with the major life events
of the employer’s family—for example, Theodor Sehmer’s ‹ftieth birthday
celebration in 1897, which included employees and the singing club of his
machine factory, the choir from the local regiment, a Chinese lantern procession and serenade, and a dinner in a local restaurant; or the wedding
reception held for Stumm’s daughter, which included workers of his steelworks in a series of festivities, including a concert, in his park surrounding
his estate.50

34

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

As this gendered activity suggests, the bourgeois model of the family
authorized a range of tutelary practices and work rules that involved the
regulation of the private sexual and marital lives of workers and their
families. In Neunkirchen, young workers could be sacked for illicit (i.e.,
nonmarital) cohabitation, and at several ‹rms, workers who wished to
marry were expected to seek approval for their marriage from their
employer. In the case of marriage, workers had to prove they were of the
requisite age and possessed the necessary ‹nancial means and that the
prospective wife demonstrated the appropriate moral virtue. This practice was not motivated by “feudal” ambitions; it was a consummately
bourgeois practice. As Stumm explained, it was an attempt to address a
problem widely discussed in middle-class circles: the “breakdown of the
working-class family.”
When a worker marries in his early years, before he has earned a high
wage and before he can save enough, all collapses at the ‹rst downturn of the economy. If the man becomes ill or is temporarily unemployed, immediately dif‹culties arise, which often lead to drinking,
dishonesty, or other ruinous consequences. They grow in proportion
as the size of the family increases, and the complaints raised about
them in some heavily populated communities are well known. Many
such marriages are conceived in the delirium [Taumel ] of the Kirmes
[religious ceremony] or in the greatest wantonness [Leichtfertigkeit]—
and in a few years bitterly regretted.51
By requiring approval before marriage, Stumm felt he could ensure the
success of the proposed union—a concern shared by other Saar factory
owners and directors of diverse political af‹liations.52
The paternalist preoccupation with morality, orderly conduct, and
sexual and marital relations among workers also found expression in the
aims and practices of company social provision. The most important goal
of this kind of company muni‹cence was the cultivation of orderly family
arrangements, conceived according to a bourgeois model of moral comportment and family life. This family ideal was to be realized in a dual
sense. First, company welfare served to foster “friendly, patriarchal relations between employer and employees” and institutionalized the relations
of the factory family, by designating the employer as the provider while
designating the workers as recipients of social provision.53 This was a relationship of hierarchy that was routinely reinforced during factory cere-

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

35

monies, which brought employers together with workers for the presentation of company benevolence and largesse, and in various communications between factory management and the workforce. For example,
when, during a factory ceremony in 1890, Director Hans Seebohm of the
Burbach steelworks warned his employees not to “allow themselves to be
misled into their own ruin” by joining an independent labor organization,
he was reemphasizing the role of the ‹rm as “provider” of workers and
their families.54
Second, the bene‹ts offered by large industrial ‹rms in the Saar were
designed to cultivate the bourgeois family norm among workers or within
working-class communities by de‹ning and sustaining the male worker as
the principal breadwinner and his spouse principally as wife and mother.
In Saar mining, this was the explicit motivation behind housing premiums,
which were offered only to workers over twenty-‹ve years of age with families. The male breadwinner norm was also structured into the sickness and
pension funds, which calculated and distributed their bene‹ts on the basis
of a worker’s familial position. Indeed, the settlement policies of the Mining Of‹ce, which aimed to avoid concentrated proletarian rental housing,
were framed by a general bourgeois logic of family living. The latter
involved smaller, single-family homes with small gardens that allowed for
the “most advantageous economic and moral” employment for miners’
wives, who could then serve as both caretakers of children and agricultural
cultivators and thus contribute to the well-being of the family.55 In the
Saar steel industry, many bene‹ts were also only distributed to male workers (women were not hired by the local steel mills) who were deemed of the
appropriate age and disposition and who could demonstrate their willingness to assume the responsibilities of establishing a household. At the
Stumm steelworks, workers’ spouses were limited to the role of housewife
and mother by the factory code, according to which spouses were not
allowed to seek employment with other ‹rms or to establish their own
businesses. Moreover, Stumm offered housing, housing loans, and other
material incentives only to those workers who complied with his marriage
and other morals clauses.56 In a similar way, owners of the Vopelius glassworks openly acknowledged the gendered motivations behind their social
provisions. As with the sickness and pension funds in mining and iron and
steel production, the Vopelius glassworks distributed payments according
to a worker’s familial position, and its other programs, including factory
schools for children and girls, were designed explicitly to enhance the
“family life” of workers, to allow women to attend to their “motherly

36

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

duties” in the home, and to promote a “healthy domesticity”—all of which
constituted a “bulwark against the Social Democratic movement.”57
In these ways, Saar employers attempted to regulate the marital relations and to shape the family life of their employees. The moralizing ideal
held out to workers in the Saar by employers generally was the single-family home, that discrete social space organized around rigid lines of sexual
difference and removed from the proletarianizing effects and “public”
dimensions—the street life, community networks, and multiple family
apartments—of workers’ settlements. This ideal was implemented differently and with different degrees of success in the Saar. The Mining Of‹ce
relied on dormitories, in part to allow miners to maintain their rural holdings, and the Burbach steelworks relied on urban workers’ settlements to a
much greater extent than Stumm, who tried to offer his workers the
opportunity to purchase single-family homes. Yet even Stumm was forced
to build workers’ dormitories in Neunkirchen, and all Saar employers,
including of‹cials at the Burbach steelworks, embraced the ideal of the
single-family home. They considered the latter, with husband, wife, and
children, as the best means of inducting workers into the ways of a “thoroughly proper lifestyle” on the basis of moral probity, “stable” family relations, and bourgeois gender order.58

Saar, German, and European Paternalisms
The model of paternalist work relations known as the “Stumm system”
was widely shared in the Saar, in part because it was coordinated and
enforced regionally, under Stumm’s leadership, by means of common discussion and efforts in the leading business organizations, the Saar Chamber of Commerce, and the local Prussian Mining Of‹ce. It was secured by
effective regionwide blacklists and union-breaking measures when such
tactics were deemed necessary. Deployed against socialists who attempted
to organize in the region in 1877, such tactics were subsequently reinforced
during the Saar miners’ strikes from 1889 to 1893 and during the Christian
and socialist union drives of 1903–4. These efforts involved consultation
within the employers’ organizations; coordinated announcements and policy statements in the central employer press organ, the Saarbrücker Gewerbeblatt, as well as industry-friendly newspapers (especially the Saarbrücker Zeitung); and deliberations between local state of‹cials— including
mayors and the Landräte [county commissioners] and Saar employers.

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

37

Despite this regionwide cooperation and these shared concerns, however, it is important to note the different articulations of paternalism and
the religious and political diversity of paternalist employers, even in the
Saar region. The ensemble of disciplinary rules and social provisions of the
paternalist regime was embraced by different employers and compatible
with different forms of business ownership. It was implemented by
Stumm, a Calvinist and Free Conservative, at his steelworks in
Neunkirchen, Brebach, and Dillingen; by Karl Röchling, a Protestant
National Liberal whose con›ict with Stumm over economic policies in
relation to foreign trade are often cited as proof of his liberalism, at his
steelworks in Völklingen; by Hans Seebohm, the Protestant National Liberal director of the Burbach steelworks, which was not family owned but
part of a foreign-owned joint-stock company, the Luxemburger Bergwerks- und Saarbrücker Eisenhüttengesellschaft; and by René von Boch, a
Catholic National Liberal, at his ceramics concerns in Mettlach and
Wallerfangen. This ensemble included various bene‹ts, from wage
bonuses to company housing, but also invasive factory work rules like the
marriage clause, which was not con‹ned to the Stumm steelworks in
Neunkirchen; there were similar clauses, for example, at the Burbach steelworks and the ceramics foundries of Villeroy & Boch.59 Moreover, some of
the classic signs of what was once thought to be a “feudal” entrepreneurial
class were broadly shared across the region. In this regard, it is telling that
not only Stumm but Röchling, Villeroy, the leather manufacturer Heinrich Korn of Saarbrücken, and even Theodor Sehmer, the less antiunion,
Protestant-liberal owner of the Ehrhart & Sehmer machine-making factory in Schleifmühle, lived in “villas” rather than modest homes. In their
architectural styles and apportioning of space, the villas were designed as
“expressions of the representational needs” of a self-con‹dent bourgeois
class, “af›uent Bürger and manufacturers,” not as representations of feudal relics of a bygone era.60
The paternalist practices of Sehmer serve to highlight both the diversity of paternalisms and the way in which one version, the “Stumm system,” largely succeeded in imposing its own dominance in the region.
Sehmer, who built his factory with Ludwig Ehrhart in 1876, adopted many
of the paternalist institutions and practices of other Saar employers: he
created a support and pension fund for his workers as early as 1876; the
factory had its own choir association (Gesangverein); and employees participated in factory ceremonies and rituals, during which Sehmer extolled
the virtues of the “peaceful” relations between employer and employee.61

38

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

But Sehmer frustrated local state of‹cials and other industrialists with his
relative toleration of (or at least failure to police) workers with socialist
sympathies. During the antisocialist period of the mid-1880s, a number of
workers at Ehrhart & Sehmer, along with workers at the state-owned rail
yards in St. Johann, were discovered to be Social Democrats. Local
of‹cials warned Sehmer, who opposed social democracy, but he disputed
the socialist af‹liations of his workers and did not take action against
them. Only in mid-October 1884—when state of‹cials, including the
mayor of Malstatt-Burbach, the Landrat in Saarbrücken, and the
Regierungspräsident [District Governor] in Trier, joined with local
employers, including especially Stumm himself, and approached
Sehmer—did he dismiss the socialists among his workers.62 This amounted
to a systematic campaign, in which local police and state of‹cials searched
the homes of suspected Social Democrats, arrested them, and even
attempted to force the principal “agitators” out of the region. At least
until the early 1890s, it effectively ended any serious Social Democratic
activity in the region.
Moreover, the range of paternalist factory regimes (their varied articulations in relation to forms of business organization, industry, religious
af‹liation, and party political orientation) are evident from broader German and European comparisons—an indication of the wider resonance
and productivity of paternalist vocabulary and practice obscured by the
single-minded focus on Krupp and Stumm in German historiography.63 In
Germany, invocations of the factory family and the employer as provider,
the stress on personal relations between “master” and “man,” and efforts
to institute extensive work rules and company bene‹ts and to orchestrate
factory ceremonies in order to secure a stable labor force and “harmonious” work relations were not limited to the large-scale mining and ironand steel-producing ‹rms associated with the CVDI or the Ruhr-dominated Association of Iron and Steel Industrialists (Verein Deutscher
Eisen- und Stahlindustrieller, hereafter VDESI).64 They also variously
de‹ned the labor regimes of large textile ‹rms in the Rhineland and Westphalia, the electrotechnical and “rationalizing” ‹rms like Siemens, chemical concerns like Bayer in Elberfeld and Leverkusen, or the Hohner musical instrument factory in Württemberg. As Thomas Welskopp reminds us,
they were integral to the managerial practices of a liberal manufacturer
like Friedrich Harkort, whose machine factory in Wetter in the Ruhr was
one of the ‹rst ‹rms to develop a paternalist system. In the case of
Harkort, “company patriarchalism, market radicalism, and liberal

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

39

engagement went entirely hand-in-hand.”65 Moreover, paternalist discourses and institutions, which were politically and religiously diverse,
were evident in a variety of industries across Europe during the nineteenth
century: they shaped labor relations in mining in the northeast of England
and Scotland and northern and southeastern France; steelmaking in
northeast and northwest England and northern and northeastern France;
and textile manufacturing in Lancashire and the West Riding in England
and in Roubaix, Rouen, and Alsace in France.66

Saar Paternalism and State Sozialpolitik
If Saar paternalism bore similarities with paternalisms in other regions
and other parts of Europe, the distinctiveness of the German case lies in
the capacity of heavy industrialists to impose much of their version of
paternalism on the nation as a whole during the 1870s and 1880s. As a
model for industrial relations, the paternalist regime in the Saar, Ruhr,
and other centers of German heavy industry was extremely in›uential in
shaping the new state social policies introduced under Bismarck direction
by the imperial government in the 1880s, even if state of‹cials like Theodor
Lohmann of the Prussian Ministry of Commerce actually drafted key welfare policies.67 In this way, work relations and workplace institutions in
the Saar were closely interarticulated with state regulatory and welfare
institutions in ways that secured the paternalist model both at the level of
state welfare and at the industrial workplace during the 1870s and 1880s.
The ‹rst comprehensive response to socialist activity in the Saar came
not from the Prussian or imperial governments in Berlin but from local
employers and state of‹cials after the Reichstag elections of January 1877.
Initially, Social Democrats attempted to organize Saar workers brie›y in
1872, but they were thwarted by local resistance and state repression. During the more sustained recruitment drive of March and May 1876, Social
Democratic meetings in St. Johann, which were coordinated out of
Mannheim, were also shut down by local police. Social Democratic organizers Carl Hackenberger and Friedrich Wilhelm Raspe, who studiously
refrained from making controversial statements, were promptly sentenced
in April and May to prison terms of one year and one month, respectively,
for promoting the cause of the party. The turning point for Saar industrialists came in the summer of 1877, when Social Democrats Hackenberger,
now released from prison, and Harry Kaulitz began to hold meetings

40

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

“almost day by day in the most disparate localities,” including the mining
communities, and began publishing their own newspaper, Die Freie
Volksstimme, in St. Johann. Convinced that the efforts of mining of‹cials
to confront Social Democratic speakers during their meetings would not
keep the movement in check, Mining Of‹ce chairman Adolf Aschenbach
invited the employers of Saar heavy industry to a meeting on 6 June, during which they agreed to the formation of the Employers’ Committee for
the Struggle against Social Democracy.68 Under the leadership of Aschenbach and Stumm, the committee declared a ban on their employees’
“direct and indirect” involvement in Social Democratic activities, especially the reading or distribution of party-related literature, taking part in
socialist meetings or associations, or visiting “taverns in which Social
Democratic meetings are held or literature of this movement is available.”
Any worker who violated the decree would no longer ‹nd work at any of
the participating ‹rms, which in June employed some thirty-six thousand
workers.69
The committee instituted a regionwide network of surveillance and
blacklisting, its own “Anti-Socialist Law,”70 which effectively suppressed
the Social Democratic movement in the Saar. It sent its own of‹cials,
“reliable persons,” and even a stenographer to Social Democratic meetings in order to gather information about which workers were attending
and to record the statements of meeting organizers and participants. The
reports were shared among the ‹rms and with local state of‹cials, mayors,
and the Landrat in Saarbrücken, so that disciplinary and legal action
could be taken against their employees and socialist activists. Local
authorities acted swiftly and ruthlessly. By the end of July 1877, Hackenberger and Kaulitz were under arrest and charged with “incitement” to
“class hatred” and “resistance against the authority of the state”; in
August, they were both sentenced to two and one-half years in prison.
Kaulitz’s three replacements as editor of Die Freie Volksstimme were all
arrested, one after another, in July and August, and the newspaper’s
of‹ces were sealed; Kaulitz’s bookstore was closed, and its contents were
con‹scated in October; and the newspaper’s colporteur, Franz Sater, was
expelled from the region in November. Four other socialist organizers
escaped to Belgium by August, while the last remaining activist, Franz
Heinrich Mathis, was arrested in December for selling Social Democratic
brochures.71 In 1881, the Mining Of‹ce, a “neutral” state institution, withdrew from the committee, but Saar employers maintained the surveillance
and blacklisting practices under the auspices of their new regional organi-

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

zations, the Southwest Group of the Association of Iron and Steel Industrialists (Südwestliche Gruppe des Vereins Deutscher Eisen- und Stahlindustrieller, hereafter SGVDESI) and the Association for the Protection
of the Common Economic Interests of the Saar Region (Verein zur
Wahrung der gemeinsamen wirtschaftlichen Interessen der Saarindustrie,
hereafter VWGWISI), established in the summer of 1882.72
This regional coordination of antisocialist and antiunion suppression
anticipated similar measures implemented in other industrial regions and
the Anti-Socialist Law introduced in the Reichstag by the imperial government the following year. In the context of regional Social Democratic
mobilization, employers in the Ruhr met in mid-June 1878 to plan their
own antisocialist measures. When some six hundred industrialists met in
Düsseldorf toward the end of June in a large meeting sponsored by the
Ruhr-based Langnamverein, they announced a regionwide effort to
employ “all legally and morally permissible means” to silence Social Democratic activity among industrial workers.73 Similar kinds of actions followed in other industrial areas—in the region around Dortmund and in the
districts of Solingen, Lennep (especially in the cities of Ronsdorf and Remscheid), Neuwied, Cologne, Koblenz, Kreuznach, and Wetzlar. In many
cases, these actions were undertaken by employers in large-scale industry in
conjunction with local state of‹cials.74 Moreover, the latter often recognized these actions and held them up as models for state action, just as
employers attempted to prompt state of‹cials to undertake similar kinds of
measures. Indeed, the meeting of Ruhr industrialists in late June 1878 was
designed to appeal to the Reichstag and state of‹cials. In the ‹nal point of
their resolution, they called openly for state action: “In so far as the businessmen are determined to do what their obligation as citizens requires, so
they expect from the organs of state government and the appointed representatives of the nation the necessary support, by means of the aggressive
implementation of existing laws as well as by means of changes to existing
laws, which have permitted the decline of the sense of justice and duty
among the working population and the proclivity toward agitation that is
hostile toward the state and culture.”75 The concerted response of industrialists in heavy industry therefore served as the model for Bismarck’s AntiSocialist Law of October 1878, which enacted parallel measures of direct
repression against Social Democrats. During the legislative debates that
produced the law, the decisions of the Saar committee were addressed
directly, and employers like Stumm took a leading role in arguing for the
necessity of the legislation and its subsequent renewal.76

42

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

This pattern of local-national repression was paralleled by the close
connections between paternalist social policy in German heavy industry
and the development of state welfare programs in the 1880s. It was especially industrialists from the large-scale, capital goods, and extractive
industries centered in the Ruhr, the Saar, and Upper Silesia, but also
employers from the cotton, textile, paper, leather, glass and machine-making industries concentrated especially in southern Germany, who provided
much of the impetus behind and support for the interrelated sickness, accident, and old age and disability insurance bills passed by the Reichstag in
1883, 1884, and 1889.77 These industrialists shared a model of business
organization and faced similar economic and labor market conditions:
they represented mostly large ‹rms oriented toward the domestic market,
supported the tariffs of 1879 as a form of protection for domestic industry
and “national labor,” offered the most comprehensive schemes of company social provision, and operated enterprises with the highest rates of
industrial accidents among workers.78 They had long favored social welfare schemes, best exempli‹ed by the sickness and pension funds common
throughout heavy industry in the 1860s and 1870s, which were organized
by ‹rm and governed by a directorate comprising employees under the
control of the employer. They opposed both the free funds, organized by
occupational status and run by employees themselves, and public or
municipal funds, which were also removed from the direct in›uence of
employers, because these schemes offered industrial workers an independent means of self-help and organization and thus weakened the alleged
harmony between employer and employee. By the late 1870s, industrialists
began to call for national welfare programs in the face of the growing legal
con›icts and increasing costs associated with work-related accidents and
disability and the independence of the free funds. They also sought to curb
Social Democratic in›uence over the free funds.79 In these ways, German
industrialists combined their efforts to escape the burdens of full ‹nancial
responsibility and legal liability for workplace accidents and injuries and
to reduce the in›uence of Social Democracy and the trade unions.
The most in›uential model for the new programs of the German welfare state came, therefore, not from Bismarck and state of‹cials but from
industrialists from the Saar and Ruhr in particular, including Stumm,
Krupp, Wilhelm Kardorff, and Louis Baare, who promoted their paternalist model of company-controlled Sozialpolitik during Reichstag
debates over welfare legislation, which they hoped would represent an
“extension of proven company programs to the level of the Reich.”80

When the Anti-Socialist Law was brought before the Reichstag in 1878,
these leading voices of German heavy industry warned that coercive measures were simply not enough to contain the growth of socialism; they
insisted that more comprehensive and state-directed programs of “positive” social policy were also necessary in order to preempt socialist claims
that the state offered nothing but the suppression of workers’ organizations. In September 1878, Stumm was the ‹rst to propose a motion in the
Reichstag, supported by many of his colleagues in the Reichs- und
freikonservative Partei (Imperial and Free Conservative Party, hereafter
Free Conservative Party), calling on the government to introduce compulsory old age and disability pensions in conjunction with the antisocialist
law. He presented these ideas to Vice Chancellor Otto zu StollbergWernigerode and found support for compulsory funds from Staatsminister Karl von Hofmann, president of the Reich Chancellory. The debate
over compulsory funds was subsequently taken up by organized interest
groups, including leaders of the Ruhr Langnamverein, who invited Stumm
to speak at their meeting in January 1879 and subsequently endorsed his
proposal. Stumm reintroduced his motion in the Reichstag in February
1879, when his proposal for obligatory funds was formally debated; he was
then appointed to the Reichstag commission responsible for drafting a bill
for social insurance. The main supporters of Stumm’s obligatory funds
were drawn from the ranks of heavy industry, including the VDESI, the
Langnamverein, and the Bergbau-Verein (Mining Association) from the
Ruhr, as well as the CVDI.81
Stumm and other industrialists from domestic heavy industry supported a version of state social insurance that differed from the versions of
other industry leaders and several leading state of‹cials, including Bismarck himself, who favored compulsory funds run by a national agency
and supported with state revenues. This industrialist class fraction favored
the social insurance model of the Prussian mining industry and their own
large-scale concerns: compulsory funds that were administered by individual ‹rms, were ‹nanced by contributions from workers and employers,
and distributed bene‹ts according to the level of workers’ contributions.82
They were also concerned to incorporate workers into the machinery of a
social insurance program, under the control of employers, in order to take
advantage of its “socially integrative” functions. Compulsory funds, as
Stumm once explained, would foster the “growing feeling of togetherness
between capital and labor, between workers and employers.”83 In addition, these industrialists also sought to end the costly court battles between

44

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

employees and employers over liability cases involving accidents at
work—a key motivation in view of the liability law of 1871, which made
employers liable for workplace accidents but required injured workers and
their families to prove employer negligence and seek recompense through
the courts. This was what prompted Prussian Landtag delegate and Ruhr
industrialist Louis Baare to write a memorandum outlining a bill for “nofault” accident insurance in 1881.84
These views corresponded in many ways with the subsequent design
of the new social insurance programs, which to a large extent followed the
imperatives of representatives from the ranks of domestic heavy industry.
The sickness insurance law of 1883, which provided support to workers in
cases of temporary illness, did not present many problems for German
industrialists, because it was generally conceived as a ‹nancial supplement
to the more important accident insurance law and left the Krankenkassen
[sickness insurance funds] of the large-scale factories in place. As Maria
Breger points out, employers from domestic heavy industry, under the
direction of the CVDI, largely supported the legislation but complained
about certain of its provisions. They objected to what they deemed its
overly generous offer of bene‹ts, but they were mainly concerned with its
failure to eliminate the existing free funds—those independent insurance
organizations that were not tied to a particular factory, allegedly enabled
workers to fake sickness, and allowed Social Democrats to join.85 The
Reichstag debate over the accident insurance bill, which proposed a system of state-guaranteed bene‹ts for industrial workers injured as a result
of work-related accidents, registered a range of interests, emanating from
the political parties, social reform organizations, state bureaucrats, and
employers from all segments of German industry. But as Hans-Peter Ullmann notes, representatives from domestic heavy industry secured most of
their principal aims with the bill, which passed in 1884. The aims accomplished included elimination of employer liability; the sharing of risk
through state involvement; employer-employee copayments; employer
self-administration through “occupational associations” (Berufsgenossenschaften); and, most crucially, the rejection of the proposed “works councils,” composed of workers and employers with state oversight, which
would have offered workers a limited measure of independence in the
administration of accident insurance bene‹ts. According to employers
from domestic heavy industry, such work councils would introduce hostility and division at the workplace, destroy the “harmony” between employers and workers, and thus serve the interests of social democracy. The

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

45

CVDI prevailed on Bismarck and state of‹cials to strike the works councils from the third draft of the bill.86
Finally, German heavy industry supported the old age and disability
insurance law of 1889, though not as enthusiastically as the accident insurance law. The initial impetus for this kind of bill came from Stumm, who
‹rst proposed a similar kind of welfare provision in 1867 and 1878, but
most leaders of German industry at the time favored some kind of old age
and invalidity insurance in principle. Their main objection to the new bill
was organizational: the government initially proposed that the occupational associations, which were created to administer the sickness insurance, take over responsibility for the administration of these pensions. The
Berufsgenossenchaften now threatened to become not only an organizational competitor to existing employer organizations but an authority
capable of instituting differential pension rates—a payment scheme that
would impose heavier ‹nancial burdens on mining and heavy industry.
But industrialists objected above all to the fact that this kind of administration, with its emphasis on standardized criteria, would limit the ability
of employers to administer and control the programs themselves. This
threat to established factory pension funds was noted by industrialists
from the Ruhr and Saar in particular, but it did not prevent their acceptance of new legislation, especially once the government changed the bill
by establishing public (but regional) bodies to administer the pensions in
partial accordance with the wishes of domestic heavy industry.87
These policies ran parallel to new legislation regulating factory
inspection. Employers from domestic heavy industry opposed the kind of
state oversight, much more developed in the case of Britain, that came
with state inspections of factories and workshops, for the obvious reason
that they represented “interference” in the “private” sphere of employers.
In 1878, the Reichstag passed a new law extending the remit of state factory inspection to all industrial establishments and workshops with more
than ten employees. It created a factory inspectorate, composed of of‹cials
appointed by individual state governments, who worked in conjunction
with local police.88 Nevertheless, the introduction of the new accident
insurance law in 1884 and the creation of the Berufsgenossenschaften
allowed industrialists to contain this potential threat to their autonomy. In
contrast to the systems of independent state inspection in countries like
Britain, the 1884 law empowered the Berufsgenossenschaften to issue their
own safety regulations and to “appoint their own safety inspectors,” who
were responsible for making sure that employers adhered to the safety reg-

46

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

ulations.89 Employers themselves were therefore put in charge of factory
inspection in the context of their own trade associations during the 1880s.
Moreover, the regulatory and disciplinary intentions and gendered
bourgeois logic of company paternalism prevailed in most of the debates
over state social policy and workers’ “protection” during the 1870s and
1880s. As George Steinmetz argues, employers from the ranks of heavy
industry successfully ensured the formation of a state social welfare system
organized in accordance with bourgeois institutions and intentions and a
bourgeois logic of normalization, which sought to inculcate the norms of
“thrift,” “regularity,” “self-responsibility,” moral self-discipline, and
workplace obedience; to induce the practices and attitudes of workingclass “respectability”; and to facilitate the gendered organization of bourgeois family life among industrial workers. The social insurance schemes
performed these functions in a variety of ways: they offered bene‹ts only
to wage earners, a system that both sustained, and encouraged worker
participation in, the broader framework of “commodi‹ed” labor and elevated wage earners out of the ranks of the “dependent” poor; they paid
out bene‹ts in cash and required self-regulating bookkeeping practices in
ways that fostered “a disciplined, planful habitus among workers”; they
intervened in workers everyday lives, especially via the local health insurance of‹ces, in order to discipline and rationalize working-class behavior;
and they con‹rmed the general privileging of male industrial laborers—
and the male breadwinner norm—by failing to recognize the different
working careers of men and women and, in the cases of the invalidity and
old age pensions until 1911, by excluding married women workers from
access to bene‹ts.90 In the latter sense, state social welfare schemes followed the social policies of heavy industry very closely. The general bourgeois logic included the gendered de‹nition of work as a primarily male
activity, but it refused to acquiesce to the more thoroughgoing proposals
of the Center Party and social reformers, mooted in 1885 and 1887, for
greater restrictions, if not outright bans, on women’s work in industry
altogether.91 Stumm, long a supporter of restrictions on night shifts for
women and a determined advocate of women’s primary role in the family,
rejected such general legal prohibitions on women’s work. In this case, the
gendering of industrial labor took place within the framework of employer
tutelage, capitalist competition, and the “free labor contract,” which
claimed to leave decisions about whom to hire primarily to the discretion
of employers while leaving decisions about where to work to the discretion
of men and women workers. This perspective was successfully defended by
German industrialists in the legislative debates of the 1870s and 1880s.

Company Paternalism in the Industrial Saar

47

Employers from domestic heavy industry were able to achieve most
of their aims in the course of these early debates over state Sozialpolitik, as
well as to shape the overall course of early tariff, ‹nancial, and corporate
legislation, because they constituted the dominant class fraction during
the Bismarckian period.92 They were able to secure their interests in part
by virtue of their organizational unity, through the existence of regional
and national industrialist organizations, such as the national CVDI, the
Ruhr-dominated or Ruhr-based VDESI, the Ruhr-based Langnamverein
and Bergbau-Verein, and the new organizations from the Saar: the
VWGWISI and the SGVDESI. These organizations were constantly
engaged in public and Reichstag debates over the legislation, by means of
petition and publications in their press organs and in the newspapers
friendly to industrial interests.93 Perhaps more crucial, the leaders of German heavy industry had direct and informal access to and connections
with the of‹cials in the imperial and Prussian state administrations and
Bismarck himself. These connections and contacts were facilitated by
means of private correspondence between employers and state of‹cials
and numerous private meetings, dinners, or soirees hosted by state of‹cials
and Bismarck, occasions that Stumm and others exploited to make known
their views on the pending social legislation.94 They were also forged in
extraconstitutional institutions and advisory bodies like Bismarck’s shortlived Prussian Economic Council (Volkswirtschaftsrat), created in 1880,
which was packed with industrialists and advised the chancellor on the
new social insurance legislation during the early 1880s.95 Finally, employer
in›uence was ensured directly by the presence of industrialists and their
allies in the two main industrial parties, the Free Conservative Party and
the National Liberal Party. In this capacity, employers from domestic
heavy industry not only engaged in parliamentary debate over legislation;
they also sat on the important commissions charged with drawing up legislation. Though they were opposed by more numerous ‹rms from the
ranks of the export-oriented and consumer goods industries and small
business, though social insurance legislation was subjected to a long
process of parliamentary debate in the Reichstag over the course of the
1880s, and though its of‹cial architects were government ministers and
bureaucrats (especially Lohmann, working under the direction of Bismarck), German industrialists succeeded in imposing much of their paternalist vision on the development of state social insurance during the 1870s
and 1880s. They viewed the emergent complex of state Sozialpolitik—in
both its disciplinary and “welfare” dimensions—as largely an extension of
their own paternalist practices to the level of the Reich.96

48

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Nevertheless, these debates and connections revealed a latent tension
between employer efforts to maintain their “private” factory workplace
and their involvement in and support for expanding institutions of the
state. As a historical concentration of social groupings and discursive
‹elds, the “‹ssiparous unity” of the German state ultimately opened the
paternalist factory regime up to less predictable determinations of partypolitical debate and of‹cial in›uence.97 This process was already visible in
the debates and legislation over the social insurance programs, which registered the interests of domestic heavy industry most consistently in the
debates over accident insurance programs but also revealed the lesser
in›uence of other interests, in the Reichstag and in the state administration, when the version of old age and disability pensions favored by heavy
industry was not fully realized. By 1889, industrialists were already
expressing some concerns about changing state involvement in the paternalist workplace—the process of interposing legislation “between the
employer and the worker” and turning “voluntary” social provisions into
state-guaranteed bene‹ts. They were also increasingly alarmed at the
in›uence of “outside” parties on such legislation.98 As we shall see in the
next chapter, as long as this wider set of in›uences, especially the imperial
state and the political parties, was kept to a minimum, the paternalist
domination of Saar industrialists in the region was secured by means of
their control over local industry and the discourses and institutions of
bourgeois Öffentlichkeit.

chapter 2

The Public Sphere and Notable
Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

In an 1891 speech before a gathering of notables celebrating his own
twenty-‹ve years of service as mayor, Wilhelm Meyer presented a potted
history of his town of Malstatt-Burbach, centering on the development of
the Burbach steelworks and the other key factors in the development of
the city: namely, the prosperity of the freight car factory of Gebr.
Lüttgens, the cement factory of Böcking & Dietzsch, the coking plant of
Dupont & Dreyfus, the machine factory of Erhardt & Sehmer, the iron
smelting plant of Friedrich Müller, and others. “All of these establishments,” Meyer eulogized, “are in well-guided hands, are making steady
progress, and constitute the lifeblood of our development.”1 Emphasizing
the bene‹ts of local business for all of the town’s residents, the mayor’s
comments predictably converged with the ideological sympathies of the
employer-notables present, but they also pointed to an obvious truth: that
the foundations of company paternalism were linked to the institutions
and prevailing discourses of public political life in the Saar. This chapter
explores the ways in which the guiding metaphor of the factory family,
extensive disciplinary rules, invasive social provision, and enforced relation of deference in heavy industry were closely intertwined with and partially constituted in the wider ‹eld of voluntary associations, civic activities, municipal governance, and party politics in the region. It argues that
local industrialists and their allies forged a paternalist hegemonic order
through the narrow con‹nes and exclusionary practices of bourgeois
Öffentlichkeit in the Saar from the 1860s to the 1890s.
At ‹rst glance, the Saar region seems an unlikely location for the for49

50

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

mation of bourgeois Öffentlichkeit, understood as the social space and collective subject of a critically reasoning public. Contemporary critics such
as August Bebel, Friedrich Naumann, and Max Weber, as well as subsequent social historians, have pointed to the overwhelming and suffocating
in›uence of local industrialists and mining of‹cials on public life in the
region. The “Stumm system” reduced workers to the status of children,
controlled their lives away from the workplace, and silenced the voices of
local civil servants, confessional leaders, and social reformers who disagreed with paternalist labor policies—coercive practices that apparently
left little room for the development of a public domain of rational debate
and opinion formation. Yet the Saar, like other rapidly industrializing
regions throughout Germany and Europe, did witness the formation of a
regional bourgeois public sphere, especially during the second half of the
nineteenth century. In a social-institutional sense, the latter was constituted in middle-class voluntary associations, starting with the Saarbrücker
Casino and similar smaller casinos in nearby industrial towns and expanding out into a regionwide network of institutions ranging from charitable
societies to economic interest organizations to veterans and patriotic associations. It overlapped with the regulated domain of municipal governance, which included city and town councils and a set of activities, from
public ceremonial to council debates, that were closely linked to the wider
‹eld of bourgeois voluntary associations; and it complexly intersected
with and was born by the main regional newspapers and the networks and
institutional practices of the local political parties: the Center Party, the
National Liberal Party, and the Free Conservative Party. Moreover, bourgeois Öffentlichkeit in the Saar, as in other parts of Germany and Europe,
emerged as a “medium” for the discussion of political matters separate
from the “material sphere of everyday life, the social conditions of production” and reproduction.2 In this form, it provided a model of permissible discursive interaction based on the polite deliberation of “selfabstracted” individuals, who claimed to shed their particularity in the
process of constituting the unitary “public” and public interest and
ignored the structural interconnections between social relations and the
public sphere.3
Rather than a uniform or coherent social-discursive space, therefore,
Öffentlichkeit in the Saar was a contested ideological construction, forged
in a complex network of institutions and discourses that varied across
urban and small-town environments. Saar industrialists exercised considerable in›uence over the local public sphere and largely excluded workers

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

51

during this period, but they could never completely silence the representation of other economic interests, especially those of small business. In this
regard, it is important to note that Öffentlichkeit in the Saar rested on
important class differences forged, on the one hand, in the sociologically
and ideologically more variegated contexts of Saarbrücken and St.
Johann—the two established “Saar cities” with long-standing administrative and marketing functions in the region—and, on the other, in the more
homogeneous company towns and mining villages dominated by a small
number of large industrial concerns. In addition, the Saar public sphere
was structured in gendered hierarchies: it was predicated on the familial
model of paternalism, which allowed middle-class women into certain of
its deliberations but only in subordinate “feminine” roles. Finally, the
deepening confessional divide in the region, which evolved into another
axis of social inequality between the mostly Protestant notables and a
majority of Catholic workers, was realized in the con›ict between a
Catholic version of paternalism and the paternalism of local industrialists.
In view of these complexities, it makes sense to speak of institutionally and
ideologically diverse and potentially contradictory formations of paternalist Öffentlichkeit brought together under the hegemony of local heavy
industry throughout the Saar region from the 1860s to the early 1890s.

Heavy Industry and the Urban Environment
Paternalist relations of public authority rested on the structural interconnections between the development of large industrial concerns in mining,
steelmaking, and glass manufacturing, on the one hand, and the associated rise of an expanded urban infrastructure, on the other, as they were
forged and consolidated in the city or town council after the 1860s.4 As the
main governing institution of the locality, the municipal council made the
most important decisions over the distribution of city resources and the
development of infrastructure. In Prussia, the size of city councils varied
according to the size of the population of each city or commune
(Gemeinde). The municipal ordinance of the Rhine Province required a
minimum of twelve councillors to represent communities with no more
than 2,500 inhabitants, eighteen in those with 2,501 to 10,000, twenty-four
in those with 10,001 to 30,000, and thirty in those with over 30,000. Local
statutes, however, could ‹x the maximum number of councillors, and
since this was done by the councillors themselves, much was left to local

52

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

initiative. This proved to be an attractive means for maintaining limits on
the ability of less propertied residents to play a role in public affairs in the
industrial towns of the Saar. In 1900, for example, when the population of
Malstatt-Burbach was approaching thirty-thousand, members of the town
council voted to keep their number at twenty-four.5 By contrast, town
councils routinely conferred municipal “citizenship” rights (Bürgerrechte)
on newly arrived factory directors and managers in order to include them
immediately in the council and in the process of municipal decision making and priority setting.6 Moreover, as elsewhere in Prussia, Saar councillors were elected on the basis of a three-class voting system. The latter
de‹ned eligible voters in terms of property, age, residency, and gender:
only men who were twenty-‹ve years of age and older, possessed “independent” means, paid local and state taxes, and owned their own household could vote in municipal elections.7 This system, which divided voters
into three classes according to the amount of taxes they paid, was heavily
slanted toward the wealthiest residents and, by design, excluded city
inhabitants whose tax assessments were below the requisite minimum; it
ensured a very narrow local “citizenry” and a highly restricted “public.” In
1876, for example, when Malstatt-Burbach was home to 12,393 residents,
only 687 citizens were allowed to vote in municipal elections: 48 in the ‹rst
class, 161 in the second, and 478 in the third.8 The numbers of municipal
voters in Saar towns did not improve much before 1918. For example, in
1910, Neunkirchen had a population of 34,539, among whom only 5,565
were eligible to vote: 337 of these voters came from the ‹rst class, 1,348
came from the second, and 3,800 came from the third.9
Accordingly, the municipal councils were sites of limited and regulated Öffentlichkeit, comprising mostly propertied and educated notables
and some petty bourgeois members, with limited public scrutiny. Municipal matters deemed suitable for “public” consumption were reported perfunctorily in local newspapers, though the extent of this kind of public
access varied according to the industrial structure and sociology of the
municipality or Gemeinde. In factory towns like Malstatt-Burbach and
Neunkirchen, council meetings were not readily accessible to citizens
beyond the class of local notables. Indeed, information about council
meetings and decisions was limited to brief press releases published in
approved, industry-friendly local newspapers (i.e., the Malstatt-Burbacher
Zeitung and the Neunkircher Zeitung). This was considered a service for
which the newspaper was usually granted an annual subvention, and any
“unreliable” or “unfounded” reporting of council deliberations could

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

53

lead, as in the case in Neunkirchen in 1897, to the exclusion of the newspaper reporter from council meetings.10 In this sense, municipal
Öffentlichkeit in the industrial areas was generally limited to the deliberations among town elites. These efforts to limit public involvement contrasted with the more accessible councils of Saarbrücken and St. Johann.
In 1885, for example, the mayor of St. Johann proved far more receptive to
the idea of broader public awareness of city council business. In response
to a petition from a local civic association asking that more extensive
reports of council meetings be made available to the press, Mayor Falkenhagen con‹rmed the right of public access to council meetings but pointed
out the limitations of space and the standard practice of delivering short
reports of council decisions (and not deliberations, motions, speeches, and
voting results). He proposed that the association send its own reporter,
whom the council would supply with a desk. The association sent former
Saarbrücker Zeitung editor Herrmann and obtained more comprehensive
reports of council business from then on.11
Local administration in Saar cities and towns, outside of Saarbrücken
and St. Johann, largely remained the preserve of industrialist notables and
their representatives and re›ected paternalist priorities. In every industrial
area, the town council generally included the leading factory owners and
directors from the local iron and steel concerns and the glass factories, as
well as mining directors and Steiger [foremen] from the local collieries.
Among the twenty-six councillors of Neunkirchen in 1888, for example, at
least fourteen, came from the ranks of local “industrialists.” These
included Stumm, his factory director, and three other upper-level employees of the Stumm steelworks; the two directors and two Obersteiger [mine
foremen] from local collieries VII and VIII; two owners of brick factories;
two brewers; and one owner of a sawmill.12 In Sulzbach, the site of a major
colliery and the Vopelius glassworks, the town council was dominated by
mining directors and managers from the latter ‹rm, including Richard
Vopelius himself.13 Accordingly, the organization and composition of
Saar municipal councils were shaped by paternalist assumptions and practices. The distribution of council seats generally followed a regionwide
convention: local heavy industry was allocated at least one-third of the
total. Chairman Ewald Hilger of the Mining Of‹ce openly admitted this in
court in 1904, when he noted that the mining of‹ce paid 180,000 marks per
year in the town of Püttlingen and thus had the largest stake in the affairs
of the town: “We pay two-thirds of the taxes and claim two-thirds of the
representative body.”14 In Malstatt-Burbach, of‹cials of the Burbach

54

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

steelworks similarly claimed one-third of the seats (or eight out of twentyfour) on the city council. Wilhelm Köhl, director of the steelworks rolling
mill, justi‹ed this distribution in terms of the company’s stake in the
affairs of the city. Indeed, Köhl even argued that the ‹rm was actually
underrepresented, since 33 percent of the town’s inhabitants (sixty-‹ve
hundred of twenty thousand in 1893) made their living from the steel mill
and since the ‹rm paid 49 percent of all taxes in Malstatt-Burbach. This
was a distinctively paternalist calculus: managers of the steelworks
regarded the company’s directors, managers, and employees (and other
town residents) as a harmonious unity. From this perspective, the role of
company representatives on the council was to speak on behalf of their
workers and others who allegedly bene‹ted from their largesse.15
Local industrialists were therefore able to secure their interests institutionally, by occupying positions in the main apparatuses of municipal
government. The latter included agencies and commissions responsible for
overseeing city and town budgets and the activities and institutions associated with a wide array of urban utilities and amenities, including public
and private construction projects (e.g., municipal buildings, housing,
schools, churches, bridges, streets, cemeteries, and toilets); gas, electric,
and water facilities; sanitation, police, and ‹re departments; and savings
and sickness insurance funds and poor relief agencies. In other words, the
municipal councils were involved in everything from planning large-scale
utility projects to setting the salaries of teachers and street cleaners. In
1896, to take one example, of‹cials of the Burbach steelworks sat on all but
three of twelve municipal commissions, including the budget, building and
housing, street construction, gas and waterworks, slaughterhouse, water
traf‹c facilities, poor relief, sanitation, and police affairs commissions.16
Perhaps the example that best illustrates the close relationship between the
steelworks and city administration in this sense is the case of Mathias
Raabe. Chief clerk (Bureau-Vorsteher) of the Burbach steelworks, Raabe
was also a city council member (who sat on the budget, police, and slaughterhouse commissions), chief of the municipal ‹re department, director of
the local savings and loan institution, and a school board member.17
Saar industrialists and their representatives were therefore well placed
to set budget priorities and to structure the urban environment and institutions around the imperatives of heavy industry. This involved ensuring
that the appropriate facilities and resources were available for the operation of industrial enterprises, that the relative distribution of taxes and
expenditures favored industrial development, and that certain municipally

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

55

based welfare and labor arbitration bodies favored or at least did not
impede the interests of local heavy industry. The construction of railroads,
canals, and thoroughfares, along with the introduction of water, gas, and
electricity, were always negotiated around the interests of the big ‹rms. In
terms of taxation, the in›uence of local industrialists was perhaps revealed
most clearly in Stumm’s successful efforts to prevent the conferral of
“municipal rights” (Stadtrechte) or status on the Gemeinde of
Neunkirchen. The ‹rst petition for full self-administration in Neunkirchen
was submitted in 1876, when the city’s population reached ten thousand,
but by 1900, when it was the home to some thirty thousand residents,
Neunkirchen was still classi‹ed as a Gemeinde. The major stumbling block
was Stumm. The conferral of municipal status would force a reconsideration of the tax burdens assessed to Ober-Neunkirchen, where most of the
town’s citizens, including workers of the steelworks, lived, and to NiederNeunkirchen, where the factory and employee housing were located.
While both Gemeinden shared urban facilities and amenities (from water
to schools), they were discrete municipal entities in relation to business
taxation. In this way, Stumm was able to keep taxes in NiederNeunkirchen to a minimal level, since the factory generated large pro‹ts
and since there were very few community facilities (streets, schools, etc.)
requiring municipal funding.18 Stumm successfully exploited his economic
and political position to frustrate the formation of a fully self-administered city in Neunkirchen.
Finally, industrialists worked in paternalist fashion to control or
in›uence municipal welfare institutions, especially those designed for
workers. The city and town councils possessed jurisdiction over a number
of important local institutions involving labor questions, including housing cooperatives, employment exchanges, and arbitration courts for
employers and workers in local small industry. This allowed factory owners and council members in Malstatt-Burbach, who were responsible for
formulating and governing labor policy in nonindustrial enterprises, to
write the statutes of the local court, choose its chairman and deputy, de‹ne
its voter registration procedures, and choose the electoral commission
responsible for determining the selection of its observers (Beisitzer).19
While these courts did not involve workers from the larger factories—
who, in any case, could be controlled by means of factory disciplinary
codes and threat of ‹nes and dismissal from employment—local industrialists took a strong interest in the operations of local arbitration bodies
designated for artisanal and other forms of nonindustrial labor, because

56

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

they feared that trade unionists would secure a local presence if elected to
the managing boards of the courts. In other words, Stumm and his allies
considered the courts potential sites of more generalized labor mobilization that would enter their own workplaces.
In addition to their in›uence over resources and municipal priorities,
local industrialists sought to control workers’ behavior and activity in the
urban environment by means of coercive sanctions. In most cases, this
coincided with the paternalist emphasis on orderly behavior and moral
probity, and this ambition to construct “respectable” workers extended
well into the domain of public policing on the streets of the city or town.
Management at the Burbach steelworks regularly threatened employees
with ‹nes or dismissal from work and company-owned housing for various criminal infractions, including public drunkenness, the discharging of
‹rearms during holiday celebrations, or other forms of public “mischief.”20 Indeed, the mayor and police of‹cials of Malstatt-Burbach cooperated with company of‹cials by turning over lists of arrestees employed
by the ‹rm; and police and factory of‹cials cooperated in investigations to
determine which workers were responsible for various offenses.21 Workers
and their families living in the settlements along Hüttenstrasse and Nicolausstrasse in Malstatt-Burbach were especially targeted, and New Year’s
Eve celebrations became a regular occasion for such joint efforts aimed at
preventing what of‹cials of the steelworks referred to as “dissolute activities and indecent behavior.” In 1897, the steelworks placed a large number
of factory ‹re‹ghters at the disposal of the local police to form twelve
patrols (comprising one constable and three ‹remen each) capable of
policing the town during the night.22
More systematically, local ‹rms sought to control various forms of
popular culture that violated the temporal rhythms of “industrial time.”
This is perhaps best illustrated in the efforts of local industrialists in the
city council of Malstatt-Burbach to regulate religious festivals. As early as
1884, of‹cials of the Burbach steelworks called on the city council to combine the two separate Kirmes celebrations (in Malstatt and in Burbach) in
order to limit the festivities to one day. They complained of the dif‹culties
of keeping the factory running for days after the celebrations; the measure,
they maintained, was in the interest of the workers because it would secure
their continued earnings. The council, dominated by of‹cials of the steelworks, promptly complied. Mayor Meyer pointed to larger “national-economic reasons” for the decision: “not only the shortfall of income [Verdienst]” was a matter of concern; controlling the Kirmes was also a matter
of the “greater costs” incurred by workers’ attendance at the festivals,

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

57

especially those resulting from the ways in which the latter “undermine the
well-being of the population and affect in an unfavorable way the already
weak sense of thrift among the working classes.”23 In subsequent years, the
city council simply left the decision over which date to hold the citywide
Kirmes to company of‹cials, who generally proposed 4 and 5 August as
dates that “would best suit the interests of our ‹rm [Betriebsverhältnisse].”24 Finally, council members voted in May 1897 to cancel the Kirmes
altogether in response to factory director Hans Seebohm’s request, which
claimed that the Kirmes was no longer “appropriate to the times.”25 In
response to criticism from tavern and restaurant owners, who stood to lose
a large amount of business from the cancellation, Seebohm pointed out
that “one is not here simply for the bene‹t of the publicans.” He then
emphasized the centrality of the Burbach steelworks to the life of the city
and argued that since the workers constituted the “drinking public” and
since the steelworks paid their wages, the factory was the “provider” for
the publicans.26 This policy was then advanced by industrialists throughout the entire region, when, in 1898, the Saar Chamber of Commerce
demanded the limitation of all Kirmes celebrations, which took place in all
“districts” connected to industry, to a single day during the year.27
Perhaps most politically salient were efforts to harness the apparatuses of municipal government in order to frustrate any public political
opposition from industrial workers. As Klaus Saul has argued, these
efforts were undertaken in a number of ways.28 Commissions within the
councils could deny oppositional groups like the Social Democrats access
to major public venues or meeting halls. Mayors and local councils could
also resort to building, ‹re, and street traf‹c codes and ordinances in order
to deny workers access to meeting halls and public spaces for assembly. In
the case of the Neunkirchen city council, city of‹cials stepped up their
enforcement of such codes when miners began organizing in 1889; they
denied publicans permission to grant miners access to their meeting rooms
in their taverns after detailed submissions of architectural blueprints, shut
down meetings taking place in over‹lled halls, and refused to allow “openair” meetings by invoking the potential for the “endangerment and disruption of the peace and public order.”29 In this context, the town councils
provided a convenient meeting place in which local employers and municipal of‹cials could exchange membership lists and other information
about workers’ organizations.
Yet the in›uence of employers was not only institutionally secured
directly, in their control over city commissions and of‹ces or their coercive
interventions in relation to workers; it was also registered less directly, in

58

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

the paternalist muni‹cence and assumptions behind municipal social provision. This was the case of charitable interventions and various kinds of
social welfare, jointly ‹nanced by local industrialists and municipalities,
which extended out into the community to an extraordinary degree. The
Stumm steelworks, for example, contributed regularly to the construction
and operation of schools and churches and offered an open-ended annual
subvention in the 1890s of ten thousand to twenty thousand marks toward
“defraying the expenses of the Gemeinde.”30 Indeed, Stumm’s wealth was
so extensive that the city of Malstatt-Burbach took a loan from him in the
amount of 125,000 marks at 3.5 percent interest in 1896 in order to pay for
the costs of some of its public buildings and other facilities and to purchase
land for the extension of its public park.31 But the paternalist orientation
of this kind of activity was most obvious in the case of the new workers’
housing cooperatives, which were created largely in response to the efforts
of industrial workers to form their own unions. In 1890, for example, city
of‹cials, local industrialists, and “respected citizens” of Malstatt-Burbach
announced their proposal for the creation of a local housing cooperative
as a means of immunizing workers against the appeals of labor organizers
who sought to foster “discord and dissatisfaction” and to shatter the
“long-standing trust between workers and their employers.”32 The aim
was to create a limited liability institution that would enable workers to
purchase their own homes—that is, a cooperative that would encourage
workers to leave the larger working-class housing settlements, which were
deemed potential breeding grounds of labor militancy. In paternalist fashion, the mayor of Malstatt-Burbach and others described the housing
cooperative as a means of turning proletarians into “small property owners” as the ‹rst step toward “furthering their moral and material welfare,”
“awakening [in them] a sense for thrift and order,” encouraging “more
healthy conditions in families,” cultivating their desire for their own individual improvement, and thus steering the “social demands of workers
onto peaceful terrain.”33
Despite the convergence of industrial interests and urban infrastructure and the immense in›uence that private employers and mining directors exercised over municipal councils in the region, paternalist control
was never total during this period. Con›icts of interests emerged within
the ruling bloc and within local towns in the very process of industrial
urban expansion. This was the case with the con›ict between Stumm and
Karl Röchling, whose coal possessions in Loraine, Aachen, and Westphalia and interest in extraregional and foreign trade brought him into

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

59

local con›ict and even to a near duel with Stumm during the mid-1880s.
The dispute, centering on control over the Saar Chamber of Commerce
and Stumm’s opposition to plans to extend the Saar and Mosel canal projects, created a public rift between the two men until shortly before
Stumm’s death in 1901.34 Local con›icts also included the aforementioned
debate over the Malstatt-Burbach Kirmes, during which local small business protested the decision to limit the popular holiday to one day in the
interests of large-scale industry. Conversely, some municipal council decisions favored the interests of small business. In Malstatt-Burbach, for
example, the council’s decision to create an arbitration court for nonindustrial employers and workers in 1893 was taken with the support of
small-scale industry but against the objections of the leading industrial
‹rms, the Burbach steelworks and the Gebr. Lüttgens freight car factory,
which opposed the court.35 In addition, during the strike period from 1889
to 1893, the actions of local employers often produced new municipal burdens and con›icts. Throughout the district of Ottweiler, a number of mayors complained about the costs to local municipalities of public support
for sacked miners during the 1893 winter strike. Such ‹nancial burdens
fostered opposition to the Mining Of‹ce’s aggressive policy of dismissing
hundreds of striking miners.36 Finally, organized challenges to paternalist
control over municipal resources and priorities did occur sporadically. In
one early case in Malstatt-Burbach from November 1893, “voters” from
the second and third classes, led by an accountant and an employee at the
telegraph of‹ce, held meetings before the upcoming council elections to
contest the domination of the Burbach steelworks over city resources and
what they considered the unfair distribution of taxes and fees. They
planned to put up their own candidates, “independent men” who would
redress the “privileging” of the steelworks and the overwhelming preponderance of the “factory party” (Hüttenpartei) in the council itself.
Matthias Raabe and Mayor Meyer managed to quell this discontent, but
the very attempt to organize in this way pointed to latent tensions within
the paternalist municipal order of the Saar, particularly during moments
of wider political mobilization such as the early 1890s.37

Associational Life and the Bourgeois Public Sphere
The discursive foundations of paternalist Öffentlichkeit in the Saar after
the 1860s were secured well beyond the con‹nes of the municipal councils:

60

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

they were also institutionalized in the expanding ‹eld of voluntary associations (Vereine), including social clubs, civic and philanthropic societies,
economic interest and trade associations, veterans and patriotic organizations, and their communicative practices and public activities. These associations were dominated by male elites or members of the local and
regional “middle strata”—that is, the leading industrialists and their
upper-level managers, mining directors and of‹cials, merchants and
bankers, and local government of‹cials—whose most prominent representatives were usually Protestant. Middle-class men participated in a narrow
range of activities in associations and local and regional public of‹ces with
overlapping memberships; and they brought to these activities a shared set
of highly restrictive assumptions about the forms and procedures of public life. Nevertheless, the public sphere of voluntary associations in the
Saar was structured in relations of class, gender, and confessional hierarchy and inequality, not in mechanisms of outright exclusion. It included
workers under the tutelage of employers and bourgeois women under the
supervision of middle-class men and in accordance with bourgeois codes
of feminine comportment and masculine reason. It also proved open to
Catholics and their organizations, which broadly traversed its terrain.
As in other regions of Germany, the class dimensions of the bourgeois
public sphere in the Saar presupposed the rise of middle-class sociability
and processes of bourgeois class formation, anchored in expanding webs
of personal connections and wider social networks forged in the meetings
of social clubs, nationalist associations, local of‹ces (including poor relief
boards, school commissions, and church committees), city councils, business organizations, and the Saar Chamber of Commerce.38 The wider
social in›uence of bourgeois elites began with the local casino, especially
the Saarbrücker Casino-Gesellschaft, an exclusive social club for roughly
120 of the wealthiest and most prominent Saarländer, including all of the
leading industrialists in the region. The successor to an earlier club formed
in 1796, when Saarbrücken was part of the principality of Nassau-Saarbrücken, the casino was the locus of political discussion and “convivial
association and scholarly conversation” for the upper reaches of Saar
“society” well into the 1870s, after which it dropped its commitment to
overt discussion of political matters.39 It became the model for bourgeois
social clubs throughout the region, but in the smaller industrial towns and
communities, the connections between larger industrial concerns and the
casinos and between the interests of industrialist notables and the local
“public” interest were more intimate. In heavily working-class communi-

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

61

ties like Neunkirchen, Dudweiler, Altenwald, and Malstatt-Burbach, the
upper-level managers of local ‹rms and collieries formed socially exclusive
casinos, which allowed members to socialize without, according to Malstatt-Burbach Casino chairman Friedrich Pelzer, being “required to pass
their time with wage earners, etc., in the taverns.”40 Thus the CasinoGesellschaft of Malstatt-Burbach, which met in its own building on the
grounds of the Burbach steelworks, was primarily composed of of‹cials of
the latter ‹rm, mining of‹cials from the local colliery, and the “better segment of the Burbach population”;41 the Dudweiler Casino created in 1853
was chaired by a mining director (Oberschichtmeister) and dominated by
local mining and government of‹cials living in Dudweiler;42 and the
Casino-Gesellschaft of Neunkirchen met in a house owned by the Stumm
steelworks, was chaired by Stumm himself, and was dominated by of‹cials
of his ‹rm and other “leading” members of the local Bürgertum.43
From the 1860s to the 1890s, the casino was a crucial nexus linking
notable sociability, bourgeois “claims” to “social leadership,” and industrial-paternalist interests throughout the region.44 The Saarbrücker
Casino, for example, was the location of celebratory dinners sponsored by
the Saar Chamber of Commerce. It hosted exclusive dinners for the local
military regiment (Seventh Lancers) and elite veteran’s organizations
(Kriegervereine); it was the venue for notable celebrations of patriotic holidays such as the kaiser’s birthday as well as lectures by speakers associated with the nationalist pressure groups (e.g., the Colonial Society); and
it was the point of reception for dignitaries from Berlin who visited the
local factories and took part in paternalist ceremonies celebrating their
visits. Similar kinds of activities took place in the smaller, local casinos. In
Malstatt-Burbach, of‹cials of the Burbach steelworks and members of the
Casino-Gesellschaft (who were often the same individuals) celebrated
patriotic holidays and the public service of local elites. On one revealing
occasion in 1897, Matthias Raabe was honored for his long years of service
both to the steelworks and to the city in his various capacities as public servant. On another, in 1891, the casino hosted a meeting of town councillors
and local notables for the purposes of forming the previously mentioned
housing cooperative, jointly funded by the city and local industrial concerns, which would enable industrial workers to purchase their own
homes.45
Yet, as this fusion of sociability and public ceremonial suggests, the
casinos were only a part of a much wider ‹eld of associational activity
among industrialist notables, institutionalized in a broad array of social

62

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

clubs and organizations, which set the dominant tone of public life
throughout the region. From the 1860s to the 1880s, the links between general bourgeois sociability and the civic engagement of employers were
most immediate in the locality. Here, social clubs and organizations dedicated to conviviality and entertainment, including local citizen’s associations, carnival clubs, and choral societies, provided spaces and venues for
the forging of social ties and networks among employers and other notables. In the towns and cities, records of these kinds of Vereine reveal
signi‹cant cross-memberships. The industrialist Karl Röchling and his
sons, for example, were members of the Saarbrücker Casino, the BürgerVerein of Saarbrücken and St. Johann, and the Saarbrücken
Kriegerverein.46 In each locality, this universe of associations tended to
overlap substantially with public of‹ces and commissions. This was most
obviously the case with the municipal councils, as well as the county councils (Kreistage), which were composed of the same notable segment of the
population. Not surprisingly, the Röchlings sat on the municipal council
of Saarbrücken and in the regional Kreistag.47
Equally important to the formation of regional bourgeois
Öffentlichkeit and paternalist ambitions, especially in the years after 1890,
were middle-class nationalist associations—the Colonial Society, veterans’
organizations, gymnastics associations, and shooting clubs. The regional
branch of the German Colonial Association (later Colonial Society) was
founded in March 1884, during a meeting in the casino building, in order to
promote the cause of German colonial acquisition, overseas business creation, and “economic and cultural [geistig]” connections between Germany
and other parts of the world. By 1885, the social background of its organizers and 150 members re›ected the early unity of the local notability—the
comfortable sociability and common undertakings between and among
government of‹cials and industrialists and their managers. Its most ardent
exponents included Stumm, Vopelius, Hans Seebohm, Bergrat Jordan of
the Mining Of‹ce, and Ernst Wagner, glass manufacturer and chairman of
the two main industrial organizations.48 In the context of meetings and public lectures, the Colonial Society introduced deliberations on German imperialism, including lectures on German colonies in Africa and China, with all
their structuring orientalist and racist assumptions, as routine features of
bourgeois sociability and local notable politics, in a way that emphasized
the centrality of colonial expansion to the health and well-being of local
industry.49 This activity was directed in explicitly paternalist ways when
speakers before audiences of workers at the Röchling and Burbach steel-

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

63

works delivered lectures entitled “The Signi‹cance of Our Colonies for Our
Industry and Workers” or “What Kinds of Raw Materials Are Delivered
from Our Colonies and How Will We Put Them to Use.”50
Aside from the confessional associations, Saar employers and bourgeois notables also controlled the few extant workers’ associations—
namely, company-sponsored musical, theatrical, and conviviality clubs
and Kriegervereine—in paternalist fashion throughout the 1960s and
1880s. As the institutional embodiment of the unity and harmony of the
factory family, social clubs like the music association of the Burbach steelworks, created in 1865, comprised company officials—from the factory
director down to section foremen—and workers across the full range of
skill levels. Their involvement in company celebrations and local events
(e.g., patriotic festivities or official receptions of dignitaries) regularly performed the paternalist rituals of deference and loyalty.51 Similarly,
Kriegervereine, which were originally established after the wars of unification in order to memorialize veterans’ military service and the victories in
the wars of German unification, drew employers and workers into mutual
paternalist relations of patriotic celebration in the context of association
meetings and public ceremonial, including nationalist holidays like Sedan
Day and the kaiser’s birthday.52 By 1891, there were thirty-nine
Kriegervereine with 8,944 members in the German Veterans’ League for
the Saar, Blies, and Surrounding District (Deutscher Kriegerbund. Saar-,
Blies- und Nahe-Bezirk).53 All of them were organized according to established paternalist hierarchies. The Kriegerverein of Dudweiler, for example, comprised miners, artisans, and lower-level officials and was chaired
by a mining surveyor; the Kriegerverein of Altenwald, with 287 members
by 1909, was led by the factory owner Wagner; the Schleswig’schen
Krieger-Verein of Saarbrücken, which included numerous steelworkers,
was chaired by the military officer Sandkuhl and included Hermann
Röchling in its executive committee; and the leadership ranks of the
Kriegerverein of Sulzbach included all of the Vopelius men—the father
Richard and his two sons, Louis and Carl—and other local notables.54
Indeed, the leadership of the regional league was dominated by local
industrialists and their allies, including Karl Karcher, the factory owner
from St. Johann, as chairman; Hans von der Osten, the chairman of the
Saar Chamber of Commerce, as deputy chairman; and Matthias Raabe of
the Burbach steelworks and Louis Vopelius of the Vopelius glassworks in
Sulzbach, as regular members of the executive committee.55 Not surprisingly, the veterans’ associations were ideologically imbued with the

64

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

assumptions of employer paternalism. The league not only adopted an
antisocialist clause in January 1891; it also took up this battle against the
“inner enemy” and “social hatred” by promoting the “virtues” of workers’
social subordination and workplace obedience: “only order can govern the
world,” league leaders admonished, “and . . . satisfaction and happiness
can only be attained through work and thrift.”56
In addition to consolidating and forging class inequalities, Saar voluntary associations, like the other dominant media of Öffentlichkeit in the
region, institutionalized assumptions about sexual difference and gender
hierarchy. While men controlled nearly all such organizations on the basis
of norms associated with the masculine exercise of public reason, women
were allowed limited access to some institutions of public life, often in subordinate roles. This was most obviously the case with local social clubs like
the casinos, which included women as family members or guests of male
club members in a wide array of special activities, celebratory dinners, festivals, and family outings. The activities of the Saarbrücker Casino, for
example, were explicitly structured around the gendered distinctions of
bourgeois respectability: only men could become full members, women
and daughters were excluded from the meeting rooms and offered their
own “women’s salon,” and the outdoor and music pavilions and the ballroom were designed to offer spaces for the stylized rhythms of bourgeois
etiquette and courtship ritual. However, bourgeois women also entered
public life more directly through the local patriotic women’s associations
(Vaterländische Frauenvereine), which started with one organization in
Saarbrücken in 1860 and expanded to 4,722 members in six local branches
(St. Johann–Saarbrücken–Malstatt-Burbach, Dudweiler, Friedrichsthal,
Völklingen, Louisenthal, and Sulzbach) by 1908.57 Largely run by the
wives of leading notables, the Saar Frauenvereine engaged in a range of
activities related to charity and philanthropy—that is, in performing tasks
related to “social motherhood” and deemed suitable for women. These
activities were not incompatible with a male-dominated public sphere,
since men often presided over the associations’ public meetings, during
which female leaders and members usually sat in the audience.58 Rather
than excluding them outright during the decades before the turn of the
century, the bourgeois public sphere included women in subordinate roles
and in particular institutions and enforced strict bourgeois codes related to
female comportment as the necessary precondition for their civic engagement.
Employer paternalism was also materialized in the gendered structur-

65

ing of Saar Öffentlichkeit during this period. The metaphor of the factory
family and the status of local industrial concerns as family-owned enterprises corresponded with the gendered role divisions and hierarchies of
Saar associational life. In a way that paralleled the preeminence of industrialists in the municipal councils, the leading bourgeois associations, and
the executive committees of the political parties, nearly all of the leading
patriotic women’s associations in the region were run by the wives of
paternalist employers as well as state of‹cials and clergymen. In 1905, Frau
Schwering, wife of the president of the railroad administration in Saarbrücken, chaired the executive committee of the Saarbrücken Kreis
[county] organization, which, as indicated in the previous chapter,
included the wives of the leading employers from the iron and steel, glass,
and mining industries—Frau Röchling of Völklingen, Frau Helene
Vopelius of Sulzbach, Frau Böcking of Brebach, Frau Weisdorff of Burbach, Frau Wentzel of Friedrichsthal, Frau Bergrat Hilger of St. Johann,
Frau Bergrat Jordan of Saarbrücken, Frau Bergrat Johns of von der
Heydt, and Frau Obersteiger Ries of Dudweiler—many of whom directed
their local branches.59 These women were involved in everyday charitable
activities and certain factory ceremonies—for example, the distribution of
Christmas gifts to children of workers or to boys and girls attending the
factory schools—in ways that enacted the paternalist familial relationships
between the factory “mother” and the children of working-class families.60
They also secured donations to the Frauenvereine from all of the leading
industrial ‹rms in the region, for the purpose of ‹nancing public events
and everyday activities. The Röchling concerns gave money to the Völklingen branch, the Burbach steelworks and Frau Röchling gave to the St.
Johann–Saarbrücken–Mallstatt-Burbach branch, and the mining inspection in Altenwald gave to the branch in Sulzbach.61 In all of these ways, the
wives of Saar employers participated in the tutelary relationship of
employer paternalism, and the gendered familial understandings of business ownership and the provision of company welfare found their expression in forms of public muni‹cence and associational life involving middle-class women.
Finally, these class and gendered hierarchies were imbricated with the
confessional divide within the region, though confessional relations
changed from the 1880s to the 1890s. Many voluntary associations emphasized their religious neutrality and, like the Saarbrücker Casino, were open
to members from all religions. Local notables and industrialists in particular avoided overt identi‹cation as Protestants, in part because they

66

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

assumed a common class interest with bourgeois Catholics, but also out of
fear of antagonizing their Catholic employees and out of a purported
reluctance to introduce religious concerns into politics. Nevertheless, the
Kulturkampf of the 1870s contributed to the incipient formation of competing confessional associational milieus, anchored in separate Catholic
and Protestant charitable organizations and choral societies as well as
associations and institutions dedicated to confessionally exclusive sociability. The dominant coding of Saar associational life, however, became
increasingly Protestant once again—and confessional divisions
intensi‹ed—in response to the growing strength of the Center Party and
the threat of social democracy in the 1890s. From January to February
1889, local Protestant elites formed a branch association of the Evangelical
League for the Defense of German-Protestant Interests (Evangelischer
Bund zur Wahrung der deutsch-protestantische Interessen, hereafter
Protestant League) for St. Johann, Saarbrücken, and surrounding areas in
January/February 1889. The Protestant League sought to combat the
“growing power of Rome” and political Catholicism and the alleged
“indifference” and rampant “materialism” of the day and became a central site for an expanding Protestant milieu. In defense of “GermanProtestant interests” and “German-Protestant culture,” it gradually created a common domain of public commitment for regional bourgeois
notables—including local clergymen, National Liberal politicians, and
most of the leading industrialists and their families (the Röchling,
Vopelius, Hilger, and Stumm families)—and their petit bourgeois confessional allies involved in charitable and other initiatives. Across the region,
the commitment involved increasing numbers of general meetings, lectures, patriotic celebrations and outings, and publishing initiatives.62
At the same time, Catholic priests and laypersons in the Saar established their own voluntary associations and communicative practices,
which traversed the dominant, largely Protestant institutions and discourses of the bourgeois public sphere during these years. These activities
were mostly sponsored by the Catholic Church and were explicitly
designed to shore up the pastoral relationship between the local priest and
his mostly working-class parishioners. This began with the creation of
Catholic religious and self-help organizations, especially the St. Barbara
brotherhoods and the Knappenvereine [provident associations], for miners
and industrial workers in the 1860s. The St. Barbara brotherhoods, religious organizations run by the local priest, focused on matters related to
religious worship, especially devotional practices and ritual, but also

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

67

sought to “improve” their members by eliminating “immoral” practices in
working-class communities, especially the “misuse of alcohol, concubinage, and acts of violence.”63 The local priest also led the Knappenvereine,
which provided social support to industrial workers, including ‹nancial
assistance in cases of sickness or funeral expenses for deceased members.
The Knappenvereine similarly sought to reform the morals of their members and to cultivate workers’ obedience to employers and public authority: they sponsored biblical and patriotic readings and lectures from the
local priest or teacher, who emphasized the importance of such virtues as
devotion, probity, “submissiveness, patience, modesty [Genügsamkeit],
and duty [P›ichterfüllung],” as well as a general acceptance of earthly suffering in the expectation of future compensation after death.64 By the
1880s, Catholic associational life extended to most of the towns and communities throughout the region and included a diverse array of chorale
and musical societies, artisans and journeymen associations, youth clubs,
girls’ and young women’s associations, and charitable and educational
organizations, often with their own meetings halls in local church facilities
or the local Catholic journeymen’s house.65 Whereas Catholic associational life was situated in complex relations with and often subordinated
to the dominant institutions of local Öffentlichkeit, it also served to sustain
its own version of paternalist relations of public authority—a version that
could easily converge with the dominant structures and modalities of
paternalist public life in the Saar.

Notable Politics and Saar Paternalisms
This paternalist order in the “Kingdom of Stumm” was also constructed
on the terrain of party politics. Well into the 1890s, political life in the Saar
was dominated by the coalition between National Liberals and Free Conservatives. For the purposes of Reichstag elections, the Saar region was
divided into three electoral districts: Saarbrücken, Ottweiler-St. WendelMeisenheim, and Saarburg-Merzig-Saarlouis. Regional political life was
centered on the Saarbrücken and Ottweiler districts—largely, it seems,
because Saarburg-Merzig-Saarlouis was the most Catholic, least industrialized, least populated, and thus least in›uential district in the Prussian
Saar.66 The region was therefore dominated by the National Liberal Party,
with its stronghold in Saarbrücken, and the Free Conservative Party, led
by Stumm and Vopelius, based in Ottweiler. Indeed, in 1887, the two self-

68

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

styled “nationally minded” or “middle parties” formed a long-standing
“cartel,” which involved mutual electoral support, joint meetings, and
efforts to sustain the ideological common ground between the two parties.
The latter rested in particular on widely shared assumptions about the
bene‹ts of heavy industry and the labor policies favored by Saar industrialists—namely, the of‹cials of the Mining Of‹ce and the owners and directors of the main iron and steel concerns and glass factories. It was practically anchored in long-standing agreements over candidate selection,
which Mining Of‹ce chairman Ewald Hilger explained in an electoral
meeting in June 1893: the cartel would ensure that one seat was held by a
mining of‹cial, who represented the interests of the Mining Of‹ce, and
that the two other seats were held by private industrialists or their allies,
who represented the interests of private industry. This unity was forged in
opposition to the Center Party (and the specter of social democracy).67
The two cartel parties were based in different parts of the region but
shared a sociology that largely reproduced paternalist relations. The
National Liberal Party was sustained primarily by local notables in the
industrial areas of the district of Saarbrücken, including Völklingen, Malstatt-Burbach, Dudweiler, Sulzbach, Friedrichsthal, Püttlingen, and the
city of Saarbrücken itself. Much like the composition of the party
throughout Germany, its most active members were drawn from the ranks
of the Protestant “middle strata,” ranging from educated professionals,
industrialists, and large-scale merchants to small businessmen, retailers,
and artisans.68 Yet the local and regional occupational composition of the
party reveals a distinctive social geography: the local electoral associations
of Saarbrücken and St. Johann were far more mixed occupationally than
were the associations in the industrial towns—where mining of‹cials,
industrialists, and their managers dominated the associations during the
1880s—and the representatives of heavy industry dominated the executive
committee of the districtwide association of the National Liberal Party.69
The Free Conservative Party was based primarily in the district of
Ottweiler, especially in Neunkirchen, though its electoral fortunes were far
more closely tied to its leading national personalities, Stumm and Richard
Vopelius, and local state of‹cials. The electoral committee of the entire
district of Ottweiler for 1887—a combined list of the “middle parties”—
included a large number of factory owners, merchants, mining of‹cials,
mayors, and municipal of‹cials but only one master carpenter, four publicans, and one master bricklayer out of a total of seventy-three members.70
This social exclusivity was anchored in the deliberative routines and

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

69

existing institutions of Saar associational life, the networks of local social
clubs, trade organizations, and civic and nationalist associations as well as
the municipal councils, which liberals and conservatives dominated. The
allegedly “nonpolitical” municipal council of the steel town of MalstattBurbach, for example, was dominated by National Liberals, who comprised at least nineteen of its twenty-‹ve members in 1890.71 Similarly, at
least (and probably more than) ‹fteen of the twenty-six members of the
Neunkirchen municipal council in 1888 were also members of the recently
established National Liberal and Free Conservative cartel.72 As Thomas
Nipperdey pointed out some time ago, most German liberals and conservatives embraced a style of politics that rejected permanent party organization and the routines of mass politics in favor of loose-knit groups of local
notables and intermittent campaign activities.73 This meant that effective
party organizations were largely constituted shortly before elections; candidate selection took place usually in small, secret meetings, often in the
local casino; and larger “voter assemblies” were then held to con‹rm the
party leadership’s selection and announce the party’s platform to general
acclamation.74 This kind of “notable politics” could only permit the polite
deliberation of the “reasoning” individual, the universal and “enlightened”
public actor capable of eschewing self-interest and social particularity as
the precondition for speaking about public matters. It was founded ideologically, therefore, on the notion that only the educated and propertied
could become political leaders. In the Saar, it converged easily with the
paternalist claim that workers would best be represented by their employers, who understood better the needs of workers and the “general interest.”
Indeed, leaders of National Liberal Party framed their activities in
terms of an ideological discourse that identi‹ed the National Liberal Party
as the nonideological representative of a unitary public interest. In a typical campaign manifesto from 3 May 1898, the National Liberal electoral
committee of Saarbrücken announced its support for a number of particular legislative initiatives, ranging from workers’ social insurance to the
regulations of certain artisanal trades. Yet the manifesto was careful to
insist that the National Liberal Party was not a “one-sided economic
party”; rather, “its duty was to represent all classes active in the economic
and public life of the nation and, after considering their speci‹c interests,
to orient its focus to the common good.” In this way, the party centered its
message on a general warning to Saar voters of both particularistic threats
and the dangers of political extremism—in the form of social democracy,
“Ultramontanism” (i.e., political Catholicism), the Poles, and the Far

70

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Right.75 Indeed, in National Liberal rhetoric, the label “extreme” often
became synonymous with “other,” since it was applied liberally to Social
Democrats, Center politicians, Conservatives, and leftist liberals or Progressives.76 In the classic fashion of liberal “apoliticism,” by contrast, the
National Liberals themselves claimed to be politically “moderate” and
ideologically disinterested: they allegedly occupied a neutral space—that
is, the center—upholding not a particular set of interests but the (unitary)
“public” interest and elevating the “nation” or “fatherland” over party
and petty factionalism.77 It was in this sense that the National Liberal Dr.
Jaeger described his organization in 1893 as “a party of the general will,
not a representative of a social group (Stand), an interest group, or a confession,” claiming further that “it considers all interests which are raised
among the people, uni‹es or reconciles all con›icting interests, and subordinates all to the well-being of the whole, in which the individual interests
can also be accommodated.”78 This ideological claim obscured competing
social interests, especially those of workers, and con›ated the “public” or
“citizenry” with the local Bürgertum and the National Liberals, who
explicitly called themselves the “core of the citizenry” in 1885.79 Local
party leaders, therefore, embraced a universal orientation that de‹ned
National Liberalism not as a speci‹c ideological formation but as the
imprint of the disinterested and reasonable consensus itself.
The universalizing claims of the Saar National Liberals were articulated to paternalist assumptions and categories—an ideological formation
best understood as a form of liberal paternalism. During Reichstag elections, the causes of the German nation, the military, foreign policy, the
colonies, and “culture” were repeatedly linked to the overall prosperity of
the German economy and its necessary foundation in the existing paternalist relationship between workers and employers. This was most evident
in the repeated invocations of employer generosity and worker loyalty. In
1903, for example, Mining Of‹ce director Ewald Hilger pointed out that
since “the weal and the woe of workers depend on the election of Herr
Boltz [the National Liberal candidate], the workers are obligated to elect
Boltz out of gratitude to their superiors.”80 These appeals linked universalizing claims about the general interest to the paternalist vision of the
factory family, which was invoked by of‹cials of the Burbach steelworks
in support of the same candidate in 1903.
Workers! We have been forced to rely on common effort that can
only be realized on the basis of mutual trust. Just as in a family there

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

71

is a head who cares for everyone and must consider the well-being of
the entire family, so are we, your employers, called upon to consider
your welfare by providing wage-earning jobs and in every other way.
Our interests are also your interests. In the ‹rst instance, it is for us
and you a matter of the prosperity and ›ourishing of our steelworks.
Social Democrats and the Center Party in the Reichstag have only
special interests in mind, so we must ensure that a man who represents the general welfare and the fatherland above the parties is sent
to the Reichstag.81
Moreover, the implied threat inscribed in such paternalist expectations
was never far below the surface. In 1887, for example, Burbach steelworks
director and National Liberal committee chairman Hans Seebohm
warned other members of the electoral committee of Malstatt-Burbach of
the Center Party’s attempts to introduce “divisions” in the electorate:
“Above all, make it clear to misguided workers that the patience of
employers may one day come to an end, and the latter could turn to measures that departed from their heretofore well-meaning disposition. Who
would guarantee the support of the poor families of these misled workers—these unconscionable agitators?”82 National Liberals saw no contradiction between putatively sel›ess and impartial claims to represent the
“reasonable” general interest, on the one hand, and the paternalist habit of
speaking from a position of “natural” authority over workers and issuing
threats, on the other.
The Free Conservative Party was more openly “Christian” and more
directly coercive in its paternalist orientation than the National Liberal
Party. It centered its ideological message on loyalty to the kaiser, praise of
the army, national unity, confessional “peace,” Christianity, and, above
all, economic and social policies designed to protect “national labor.” An
electoral notice of 1889 invoked the “unity and greatness of the Reich
under the guidance of a strong royal hand” and stressed the party’s support for legislative “measures that protected national labor and bene‹ted
the working classes.” It praised Stumm for his extensive factory social provision, which anticipated the welfare schemes of the Bismarckian government, and for his paternalist interventions at the workplace: “he always
maintained order and discipline at his factory; he knows how energetically
to combat the incitement of diligent workers by Social Democratic agitators [Verführer]; he has generally cultivated good, Christian morals; and he
has helped to turn churches and schools into nice homes [schöne Heim-

72

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

stätten].” In these ways, Stumm was portrayed as a staunch defender of the
monarchy and the German nation; a paternalist provider of jobs, whose
commercial efforts had opened up “fresh sources of sustenance”; a protector of working-class families; and a guarantor of moral-political order
more generally.83
In a much more open and explicit way, Stumm and the Free Conservatives presumed to speak on behalf of workers and instructed them on
speci‹cally how to vote. By contrast with the more indirect notices of
National Liberals, exempli‹ed in the notices at the Burbach steelworks
that called on workers to act as “honorable men,” Stumm posted unsubtle
threats to employees on the main entrance of his steelworks in 1887.
Your patriotic sense must again ensure that nothing prevents you
from voting unanimously for the highly respected Reichstag delegate
and Regierungsrat Bormann, to whom the factory is especially
indebted. Whoever does not do this . . . is responsible for the inevitable
collapse of well-being and income of all of us and deserves no longer
to be an employee of the ‹rm. I therefore determine that it is a duty to
God, kaiser, and fatherland, but also to the factory and yourselves,
that all of you without a single exception vote for Regierungsrat Bormann on 21 February.84
He also noti‹ed his managers that they were to use all available “means”
(Kräfte) to put the “appropriate” pressures on the workers in order to
secure their votes for the Free Conservative candidate Bormann.85
Despite these differences, the two cartel parties cooperated quite
closely when it came to controlling the voting behavior of miners and
industrial workers. In the wake of the regionwide blacklisting system that
targeted Social Democrats in 1877 and the subsequent refusal to tolerate
any socialist or trade union activity within Saar heavy industry, local
industrialists and of‹cials of the Mining Of‹ce effectively simply banned
all oppositional political activity among workers, on pain of transfer to
less remunerative employment, loss of bonuses, wage reductions, or outright dismissal from employment. Stumm even included an antisocialist
clause in his factory work rules, which state that anyone who “has in his
possession or distributes Social Democratic materials, participates in
Social Democratic meetings or associations, or frequents taverns in which
Social Democratic meetings are held or publications are available” would
be subject to dismissal.86 The Mining Of‹ce similarly banned all employee

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

73

participation in meetings of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands
(hereafter SPD) and trade unions and declared certain taverns—suspected
of allowing meetings to be held on their premises or making available
oppositional publications, including those of the Center Party—off-limits
to miners.87 In the absence of sealed ballots, which were introduced only in
1903, National Liberals and Free Conservatives were also able to police
workers as they went to polling stations, in order to prevent them from
voting for the SPD or the Center Party. Local town notables, employers,
and their managers staffed balloting stations in the industrial areas of the
Saar, including Sulzbach, Altenwald, Malstatt-Burbach, Dudweiler,
Neunkirchen, Gersweiler, Püttlingen, Altenkessel, Wiebelskirchen, Hühnerfeld, and Ottenhausen. This meant that mining of‹cials, employers, and
their allies could readily observe workers as they voted. So, for example,
the two polling stations located in the areas of Hüttenstrasse and Nikolausstrasse in Malstatt-Burbach, where most of the voters were employees
of the Burbach steelworks, were chaired by Rudolf Korten, director of the
steel mill, and Heinrich Wagner, a company of‹cial during the elections of
1903.88 In this context, National Liberal employers and managers crowded
into entryways to the stations, handed party ballots to workers, kept close
watch on them to ensure that the correct ballots were dropped in the
boxes, and even took notes as their employees entered and left the balloting stations. In subsequent court testimony, one witness complained,
“Sometimes the station is so full that there are more observers than voters.”89 Local state of‹cials, who were often members of the two cartel parties, colluded in the suppression of SPD and Center vote counts, routinely
exchanging information and lists with local employers, searching the
homes of suspected Social Democrats, and contributing to the exclusion of
socialists from the region.90 After the 1898 election, mayor and National
Liberal Hermann Offermann of Wiebelskirchen, for example, gave the
director of the local mining colliery, a member of the board of direction of
the local National Liberal electoral committee, voter lists on which persons who voted for the Center Party were indicated in red.91 Finally, these
coercive measures aimed at banning opposition were accompanied by
active efforts to round up workers, from the mining dormitories or individual sections of steel factories, and lead them in “troops” to the polling
stations to vote for National Liberal and Free Conservative candidates.92
These activities were combined with a certain ideological labor as
well. Local employers took advantage of paternalist venues to instruct
workers about election issues, political parties, and speci‹c candidates.

74

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Stumm favored the ceremonies for bonus distribution, during which he
routinely rewarded workers for choosing the “appropriate” candidates
and warned them about the dangers of radical “agitators.” During one
such ceremony in June 1893, Stumm told his workers that he was pleased
to be able to tell the kaiser “personally” about his own victory and the
“excellent behavior of Neunkirchen’s workers during the election.”93
Of‹cials of the Mining Of‹ce were able to instruct miners through their
lower-level management, especially the pit foremen, and also through the
of‹cial press organ of Saar mining, the Bergmannsfreund (The Miner’s
Friend). During the Reichstag election campaigns of 1893, for example,
the editor of Bergmannsfreund, Ewald Hilger, not only indicated that miners should support the military bill but also openly called on them to support the National Liberal and Free Conservative cartel candidates, Boltz
and Stumm.94 Leading industrialists, including Stumm of course, dismissed claims that they in›uenced workers in their positions as employers;
the opposition, they maintained, were simply unable to admit that the
workers were patriotic and loyal to their employers.95
Despite this electoral coercion, the Center Party did emerge as formidable opposition, even if it embraced its own version of paternalism. First
formed in 1871 in the region, the Center Party was based ‹rmly in the rural
electoral district of Saarburg-Merzig-Saarlouis. It later found support in
the district of Ottweiler, where it eventually won the Reichstag seat in 1903
and 1912, and more gradually in the Saar cities of Saarbrücken and St.
Johann, where Catholic leaders, mostly clergymen and lay professionals,
were based. They established their own newspaper, the Saar-Zeitung, in
1872 and subsequently began publishing the much more in›uential St.
Johanner Volkszeitung in 1884. The principal early architect of the Center
Party in the Saar was Georg Dasbach, a populist chaplain from Trier. Prevented from becoming a priest in 1875 as a result of the Prussian Kulturkampf laws, Dasbach became a tireless political activist, establishing a
press and publications network and speaking and organizing for the Center in the region around his home base in Trier but also in the Saar. In
addition to the Saar-Zeitung and the St. Johanner Volkszeitung, Dasbach
published calendars and pamphlets for working-class readers; and his
early success as an organizer for the Mainz Catholic’s Association during
the Kulturkampf was followed by less successful efforts to create Catholic
associations for miners and factory workers in the Saar during the 1870s
and 1880s.96 Dasbach, along with the lawyer Dr. Muth, who established
the ‹rst Center organization in Saarbrücken, was the key early presence in
Center electoral meetings and activities from 1874 to the early 1890s.97

The Public Sphere and Notable Politics in the “Kingdom of Stumm”

75

The politics of Dasbach and other Center Party leaders in the Saar
were premised on paternalist understandings of a pastoral relationship
between church and lay leaders and their working-class ›ock. Whereas the
electoral associations and public activities of the National Liberals and
Conservatives were dominated by industrialists and other notables, Center
organizations were run largely by priests and middle-class professionals
from the 1870s to 1914, though with important differences to be discussed
shortly. Moreover, the social orientation of the Center Party was inherently paternalistic over this period, particularly as it was de‹ned in relation to social democracy. Center Party leaders warned Saar workers away
from militancy and strikes, sought “reconciliation between the individual
classes of society,” and viewed religious piety as the best means of combating social democracy.98 The Center position on the “social question”
and the “worker question,” ‹rst addressed in 1876, criticized the “religiously indifferent” free trade policies of the liberals, and local Center
Party leaders henceforth became leading advocates for state welfare programs and protective legislation, including the protection of Handwerk, as
the principal means of alleviating the plight of workers.99 Its 1881 program
announced support for lowering taxes and distributing them more equitably, the “protection of Handwerk against industry,” and the “protection
of the worker in cases of accident and old age”; and during the elections of
1887, in which battles were fought to a large extent over the military budget, the Center called for more legislation in the interests of the “well-being
of the working class.”100 This kind of approach assumed the benevolence
and generosity of social superiors and rested on established relations of
hierarchy between priest and ›ock. In this regard, the Center depended on
the growing majority of Catholics in the region, particularly among industrial workers, and on their willingness to accept the leadership of their
social superiors in the wake of the Kulturkampf. This strategy resulted in
the slowly increasing electoral strength of the party in the 1880s.
Nevertheless, Center Party organizations drew on the contributions
of industrial workers in more direct ways. Whereas the National Liberal
and Free Conservative parties included no workers in their activities
except as passive audience members in some election meetings, the Center
organizations included shopkeepers, publicans, artisans, and even some
workers in their lists. In the 1890s, after the miners’ strikes, party leaders
began to include industrial workers on some committees. In 1893, for
example, the Center’s electoral committee backing the candidacy of Graf
von der Schulenberg in the district of Ottweiler was chaired by the clergyman Bourgeois and listed 160 members, among whom were thirty-two

76

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

miners (active, pensioned, and sacked) and at least three industrial workers.101 Moreover, activists like Dasbach, who sought to attract miners and
factory workers in his publications, became so popular by the 1880s that
they were routinely sought out by Saar miners with complaints about
working conditions. This practice was re›ected in Center Party election
meetings, which included some participation by workers, and in the
increasing crackdown of Saar employers on workers who read Center and
Dasbach publications. Thus this early participation of workers, however
limited, signaled an important difference from the practices of the
National Liberal and Free Conservative parties—a difference that, as we
shall see in chapter 4, evolved into Center Party efforts to put forward
“worker candidates” after 1903.
Center Party leaders also rearticulated paternalist assumptions within
the framework of claims about the violation of the right of workers to
associate and assemble politically, and they even invoked the freedom of
the individual in their political struggle against the cartel parties. Though
this was done primarily to secure the in›uence of the church hierarchy,
priests, and bourgeois laypersons over the worker ›ock, it eventually
helped to dislodge the paternalist authority of local industrialists and their
allies within the National Liberal and Conservative parties in the region.
Indeed, Center Party leaders ‹led their ‹rst legal challenge to the coercive
practices of local industrialists and their allies after the Reichstag election
in the district of Ottweiler in 1881. In defense of the right to free political
expression, they charged supporters of Stumm’s party with various acts of
illegal electoral in›uence, involving the surveillance of miners in polling
stations by mining of‹cials and the violation of ballot secrecy by a local
state of‹cial. The results were subsequently nulli‹ed by a Reichstag commission in 1884. This kind of recourse to legal protest proved to be an
effective weapon for the Center Party in the Saar during later elections,
including the Reichstag elections of 1893, 1898, 1901 (necessitated by
Stumm’s death), 1903, 1907, and 1912. It not only put pressure on the cartel parties, which were forced to disguise their coercive practices; it also
resulted in the invalidation of the results of two elections. Thus the election
of the industrialist ally and National Liberal Heinrich Boltz in the district
of Saarbrücken in 1898 was invalidated by a Reichstag commission in
1902; and during the same year, the election of Stumm’s successor to the
Reichstag seat in Ottweiler was similarly rendered invalid.102 Formal legality, the relative integrity of the German electoral system, and the commitment of most state of‹cials and political parties to the principle of com-

petitive elections, as Stanley Suval and Margaret Anderson argue, meant
that oppositional parties like the Center could actually contest local structures of authority.103 Indeed, as the protests of the Center suggest, Saar
paternalism rested not on total control over the local public sphere but on
a wider balance of discursive and other social forces—an environment that
decisively shifted and opened up possibilities for reform in the context of
new state initiatives and worker protest during the early 1890s.

Challenges to Paternalism: The Battle
over the Insubordinate Worker from “New
Course” Reform to “Stumm Era” Reaction

The ‹rst comprehensive challenges to the “Stumm system” in the Saar
were linked to the changing relationship between the state, the public
sphere, and the industrial workplace during the 1890s. The decisive
moment came when Kaiser Wilhelm II announced a new orientation for
state Sozialpolitik. This “New Course” entailed Bismarck’s resignation
and the appointment of Leo von Caprivi as chancellor and a fundamental
departure from the underlying principles of Bismarckian social policy: it
favored regulatory measures that were designed to facilitate labor conciliation rather than paternalist coercion and containment. Introduced to the
Reichstag by the new Prussian commerce minister Hans von Berlepsch,
the core of the New Course was a set of workplace regulations and institutions mandated by the Industrial Code of 1891, which brought the central
state into more direct engagement with the workplace “rights” of industrial workers. This opened up vital political space for Saar miners and
workers, who began to contest the conditions of work in the state-run collieries and the privately owned factories from 1889 to 1893. They did so by
creating their own organization, the Legal Protection Association for the
Miners of the Upper Mining District of Bonn (Rechtsschutzverein für die
bergmännische Bevölkerung des Oberbergamtsbezirks Bonn, hereafter
Rechtsschutzverein) and new forms of proletarian Öffentlichkeit. The latter were anchored in the discursive structures of the bourgeois public
sphere and the miners’ own “contexts of living”—the ensemble of everyday rhythms and forms of symbolic expression that characterized social
interactions among workers in the collieries, factories, and working-class
78

Challenges to Paternalism

79

communities. This proletarian “counterpublic” evolved as a “parallel”
arena in which miners and workers were able to “formulate oppositional
interpretation of their identities, interests, and needs” in ways that ultimately violated the discursive modalities and structuring parameters of
the bourgeois public sphere.1 It proved short-lived but prompted new
responses from bourgeois social reformers, with important consequences
for politics in the region.
Rejecting the overtly coercive intentions and practices of factory
paternalism and against the backdrop of the New Course, a diverse array
of Catholic and Protestant clergymen and Center Party and liberal
reformers began to experiment with new strategies of social reform that
would target the subjectivities and intimate lives of Saar workers in order
to invite their active consent to workplace hierarchies and to prepare them
for orderly participation in the bourgeois public sphere. Toward this end,
the regional Catholic clergy and bourgeois laity created two new organizations, the People’s Association for Catholic Germany (Volksverein für
das katholische Deutschland, hereafter Volksverein) and the League of
Catholic Miners’ and Factory Workers’ Associations (Verband der
katholischen Berg- und Hüttenvereine). Protestant clergymen and local
reform liberals responded with the formation of the Protestant workers’
associations (Evangelische Arbeitervereine) and a new interest in social
reform, particularly the ideas of Friedrich Naumann, one of Germany’s
leading liberal Protestant pastors, emanating from a local reform organization called the Artisans’ Association [Handwerkerverein] of Saarbrücken. This turn to social reform was conducted largely on the rhetorical terrain of paternalism itself: it was animated by an insistently gendered
and moralizing preoccupation with the internal relations of the workingclass family and sought to induct Saar workers into the values and ideological commitments of a religiously informed middle-class lifestyle (Bürgerlichkeit). But rather than resecuring a hegemonic paternalist order
guided by Stumm and his allies, the new reform movements inaugurated a
period of intense political con›ict over the shape of the industrial workplace within the local Bürgertum during the mid-1890s.
These con›icts were part of a wider debate over the direction of
Sozialpolitik taking place nationally during the so-called Stumm era of the
middle to late 1890s in imperial Germany. The resignation of Caprivi and
his replacement with Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst as chancellor
in October 1894, along with the replacement of Count Botho zu Eulenburg
with Ernst von Köller as Prussian interior minister, marked the end of the

80

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Berlepsch reform initiatives and the renewed ascendancy of Stumm and
other conservative industrialists. The latter were able to reestablish some
of their former in›uence over the new government of‹cials during the second half of the 1890s and attempted to undo the consequences of New
Course reforms by means of new repressive antisocialist and antiunion legislation, including the Revolution Bill of 1894–95, the Prussian Association
Law of 1896–97, and the Penitentiary Bill of 1899.2 But these attempts
called forth new and countervailing developments, which challenged this
paternalist reaction: the unprecedented proliferation of competing social
reform discourses and initiatives outside the paternalist model.3 This chapter focuses on these challenges from the New Course to the “Stumm era”
and explores their destabilizing impact on the main institutions of the
paternalist public sphere in the Saar during the 1890s.

The State, the New Course, and Labor Protest
In February 1889, Kaiser Wilhelm II signaled his desire to become a
“workers’ emperor” and formally broke with the main principles of Bismarckian Sozialpolitik. In a speech before the League of German Occupational Associations (Verband deutscher Berufsgenossenschaften), he
announced that it was his duty “to make sure that the workers are guaranteed the protection that is coming to them” and that all “workers” must
be guaranteed “legal equality” and should “feel themselves to be a fully
empowered estate within the state, and as such they will be recognized by
all.”4 One year later, the kaiser put forward a series of proposals for regulating the conditions of work in German industrial enterprises, known as
the February Decrees, which were then turned into a set of legislative initiatives (whose principal architect was the newly appointed Prussian commerce minister Hans von Berlepsch) and brought before the Reichstag as
a new industrial code bill in May 1890.5 The bill, which drew on previous
Reichstag legislation calling for labor protections, introduced numerous
workplace reforms: safety rules and requirements for the proper maintenance of industrial establishments, restrictions on the employment of adolescents and children, and restrictions on women’s work, including a ban
on night shifts, the introduction of a maximum eleven-hour day, shortened
Saturday hours, extended lunch breaks during the workweek, and unpaid
leave for new mothers and women about to give birth. It also called for
new provisions regulating workplace negotiations between employers and

Challenges to Paternalism

81

employees: industrial courts (Gewerbegerichte), formed on the basis of
parity between workers and employers in small industry with state oversight in local communities throughout Germany, in order to provide
mechanisms for resolving labor-related disputes; and mandatory works
councils (Arbeiterausschüsse) to facilitate industrial bargaining between
workers and employers in large-scale industrial enterprises. In this regard,
the bill introduced provisions governing the content and presentation of
factory work rules (Arbeitsordnungen). In an effort to curb the punitive
“arbitrariness” of employers, it established restrictions on the rights of
employers to sanction workers for behavior away from the workplace, a
standard maximum for workplace ‹nes, and the requirement to post work
rules on the premises of factories employing twenty or more workers, in
order to ensure that all employees were aware of company regulations and
to force the latter to conform to the dictates of legality. Finally, the bill
called for an expansion of the state factory inspectorate by increasing the
numbers of state safety inspectors, who were independent of the employercontrolled Berufsgenossenchaften, and authorized the creation of the
Imperial Commission for Labor Statistics, responsible for gathering information on conditions in German industrial enterprises.6
In contrast to their role in the passage of the social insurance bills of
the 1880s, German industrialists, especially those associated with the
CVDI, opposed key components of the new legislation. Their objections to
some of the restrictions on women’s work focused mainly on the generalizing tendency of the legislation, which applied to all industrial concerns,
and were in part satis‹ed by the decision to allow the Bundesrat [Federal
Council] to make exceptions in individual cases. Most industrialists were
able to accept these restrictions because they were framed in terms of the
gender framework of paternalist practices and were long favored by industrialists like Stumm.7 But they vehemently opposed provisions calling for
increasing state oversight and the creation of institutions for worker selfrepresentation at the workplace. Stumm (whose work rules became the
subject of much Reichstag debate) and other industrialists and leaders of
the conservative parties objected to the proposed regulation of factory
work rules, defended the right of employers to control the political and
other activities of workers outside of the industrial workplace, and managed to contain the more far-reaching provisions related to limits on maximum workplace ‹nes and the requirement that work rules be posted in all
‹rms (the regulation ultimately only applied to ‹rms with twenty or more
employees).8 Stumm, Krupp, and Hanns Jencke, general director of the

82

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Krupp concerns, used their in›uence in the Prussian Council of State, of
which they were members, to strip the provision for mandatory work
councils from the proposed bill.9 As a result, the legislation only provided
for the introduction of works councils in state-run enterprises and recommended their introduction in private heavy industry on a voluntary basis.
Nevertheless, industrialists like Stumm faced a new regulatory regime
when the bill was passed in altered form by all parties except the SPD in
1891 and became the new industrial code. The legislation gave state of‹cials
new responsibilities in regulating and monitoring the industrial workplace
in Germany. Moreover, the kaiser’s February Decrees provided legitimacy, however inadvertently, for the self-mobilization of workers, especially in the Saar, where the state-run mines were held up as “model institutions” and where works councils were eventually introduced.
Indeed, when the kaiser received a strike delegation of Ruhr miners in
Berlin on 14 May 1889, he helped to set in motion a new dynamic of industrial bargaining between extraregional state of‹cials and Saar miners, who
met en masse in Bildstock on 15 May, launched their ‹rst strike on 21 May,
and formed their own organization—the Rechtsschutzverein—on 28 June.
Led by the miner Nikolaus Warken, the Rechtsschutzverein immediately
turned into a critical forum for the articulation and representation of miners’ interests in relation to the New Course and the kaiser’s February
Decrees, which became the “credo” of the organization.10 It also became
the principal medium of communication between Saar miners and extraregional state of‹cials. From the beginning, its leaders pressured upperlevel mining officials for better working conditions, a course of action that
ultimately prompted the formation in mid-July of a state investigative
commission responsible for reviewing the written demands and claims of
the striking Saar miners in the spirit of “impartiality”;11 in December, they
secured an audience with Berlepsch (as Oberpräsident) and upper-level
mining of‹cials in order to negotiate working conditions and the rehiring
of sacked Rechtsschutzverein activists; and they began to work through
and energize the “works councils,” introduced in Saar mining with elections for council members in early March 1890. When the Rechtsschutzverein sponsored a May 1890 meeting of works council members in
Völklingen, its leaders not only described its efforts as the ful‹llment of the
kaiser’s wish that the “Saar mines would be model institutions”; they also
drafted a new twenty-four-paragraph petition, the “Völklingen decisions,”
which they sent to the Reichstag.12 During the ‹rst two years of these
protests and negotiations, the Rechtsschutzverein reported impressive

Challenges to Paternalism

83

membership gains: by November 1889, 6,731 miners had joined the new
organization; just over one year later, the ‹gure stood at 20,118; and by the
summer of 1891, the Rechtsschutzverein had organized 24,270 miners, or
81 percent of all state-employed miners in the region.13
This new public activity and orientation combined with rank-and-‹le
radicalism to challenge several pillars of the paternalist regime in Saar
mining. At their 15 May meeting in Bildstock, Saar miners called for the
introduction of the eight-hour shift, including winding time; wage
increases that would allow each adult member of the work team (Gedinge)
a shift wage of four marks; a reduction of ‹nes and penalties listed in the
disciplinary code; the opening of all colliery gates; the elimination of obligatory contributions to the miners’ savings institution; and preferential hiring of miners’ sons when possible.14 The Mining Of‹ce initially rejected the
miners’ demands, but a renewal of miners’ meetings and the strike of
11,500 miners on 23 May forced them to make concessions—namely, a new
set of work rules that set the daily shift at ten hours, promised to keep the
colliery gates open during working hours, set a minimum amount for the
team wage, and made payments to the miners’ savings institution voluntary.15 Moreover, after the Mining Of‹ce began dismissing Rechtsschutzverein leaders in September and October and the miners began to
threaten a new strike in December, the miners’ delegation that met with
Berlepsch on 13 December secured an of‹cial promise that the strike leaders sacked in the fall for their actions the previous May would be allowed
to return to work and guarantees regarding wage increases and an eighthour shift, excluding winding time—promises to be written into the work
rules.16 The following spring, the miners ramped up their challenges to the
paternalist regime during the May 1890 meeting of works council representatives, who drew up the aforementioned list of workplace demands
called the “Völklingen decisions,” which called for the eight-hour day,
wage increases, standardized wages, abolition of the Wagennullen (excessive ‹nes for mining impure coal), and the opening of the colliery gates.17
These “decisions” were followed one year later by a new set of demands,
the “Altenwald demands,” announced by Rechtsschutzverein leaders and
works council representatives on 30 April 1890 in advance of another Saar
miners’ strike from 21 to 25 May. These included the previous “Völklingen
decisions” and new demands that the Mining Of‹ce rehire all sacked
Rechtsschutzverein activists and cease all shipments of coal to the Ruhr
region, where miners were on strike. This combination of public organization and militancy from 1889 to 1891 resulted in signi‹cant wage gains and

84

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

permanent limitations on paternalist prerogatives: the annual wages of
Saar miners jumped from 976 marks in 1889 to 1,180 in 1890 and 1,212 in
1891, and the Mining Of‹ce never rescinded it decisions related to shift
times, colliery gates, and sickness funds.18
Workers in Saar private heavy industry were also able, if only very
brie›y, to establish their own forms of independent representation. Like
the miners, local industrial workers seized on the kaiser’s February
Decrees and the New Course legislation and began forming their own
“legal protection” associations. These included smaller ‹rm-based organizations at the Wendel coking plant in Hirschfeld in late March 1890 and at
the Röchling coking plant in Altenwald in mid-May 1890. But by far the
most important new organization was the General Workers’ Legal Protection Association (Allgemeine Arbeiter-Rechtsschutzverein, hereafter
ARV), formally constituted on 1 June 1890. Led by the local brewery agent
Michel Roll, ARV meetings invoked the new worker-friendly orientation
of the kaiser as authorization for their deliberations and in response to the
efforts of local industrialists to shut down their meetings and force its
members to leave the organization; and like the Rechtsschutzverein, the
ARV evolved into a critical forum for the discussion of New Course policies and for the expression of workers’ grievances.19 By the end of July
1890, with 224 members, mainly from the industrial areas of St. Johann
and Malstatt-Burbach (especially employees of the Burbach steelworks;
the machine factory of Dingler, Karcher & Cie; the railroad yards in St.
Johann; and the local artisanal trades), the ARV held meetings in which
members began to strike at the foundations of factory paternalism
throughout the region:20 they criticized everything from low wages, incentive-based wage systems, managerial arbitrariness in the large factories,
and the excessive length of the workday to the disciplinary mechanisms of
welfare provisions and the managerial coercion exercised by factory physicians at the Burbach and Röchling steelworks, who allegedly sent injured
or sick workers immediately back to the shop ›oor. They even contested
the marriage and secondary employment clauses in the work rules at
Stumm’s steelworks in Neunkirchen—the most notorious symbol of Saar
paternalism. This opposition coalesced in July, when the ARV held two
meetings in Neunkirchen, during which Roll and employees of the steelworks launched into a critique of the work rules, working conditions, low
wages, the high cost of living in Neunkirchen, and Stumm’s bribes and
threats to local publicans renting halls to the ARV. Incensed at these
attempts to destroy the organization, Roll angrily accused Stumm of buy-

Challenges to Paternalism

85

ing political in›uence: “If Freiherr von Stumm did not have such a large
money bag, then he probably would not be so fresh. Freiherr von Stumm
is no patriot but a briber and a power-hungry man.”21 Nevertheless, the
ARV never managed to break free of the social-geographical limitations
of the paternalist public sphere. Largely excluded from the company
towns where the iron and steel and glass factories were located, it was
con‹ned, for the most part, to the more urbanized spaces of St. Johann.
Indeed, without direct connections to and protection from central
state authorities, the ARV was easily crushed by Saar industrialists and
their allies. Saar employers, who were not subject to legal constraints faced
by of‹cials of the Mining Of‹ce, were able to destroy the ARV by exploiting the asymmetries of power that characterized the wage relationship and
the paternalist structures of the bourgeois public sphere. In May, the executive committees of the VWGWISI and the SGVDESI announced their
intention to refuse to employ any “worker who joins trade associations,
trade unions, or ‘legal protection’ associations that are one-sided and
aimed at opposing the employers”—a policy that would be enforced by
means of blacklists.22 According to a notice from of‹cials at the Burbach
steelworks, membership in the ARV amounted to “direct resistance
against the management of the steelworks”: “It will, therefore, be the concern of the ‹rm to remove such elements from employment with the Burbach steelworks in the interests of discipline, peace, and order. And it will
be left to the founders of this so-called legal protection association to feed
themselves and their families in the future.”23 As employers began sacking
workers involved with the ARV in May and June, they understood these
dismissals as a coercion-free exercise: according to Hans Seebohm, section
managers of the Burbach steelworks were instructed to inform their workers, “in a well-meaning fashion, about the reprehensible and ulterior aims
of the association and its leaders,” but in doing so, they were “to avoid any
kind of pressure.” “Much to our pleasure,” said Seebohm, “this advice has
met with success, and the large majority of the workers in question have
come around to a reasonable point of view and . . . have declared themselves voluntarily no longer members of the association.” Factory employees who “persisted in their blindness” and refused “voluntarily” to leave
the ARV, Seebohm warned, “would be immediately dismissed” after the
“legally-mandated fourteen-day wage payment.”24 In addition, Saar
employers took advantage of their control over the institutions and deliberative routines of local public life in order to crush the movement. Stumm
not only sacked employees involved in the ARV; he also pressured local

86

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

publicans who made their meeting halls available to the ARV, leaned on
the Neunkirchen municipal zoning commission in order to get its members
to deny the ARV access to certain public halls, and sued Roll for “slander”
in order to silence him—a strategy that successfully frustrated subsequent
attempts to hold ARV meetings in Neunkirchen after July.25 These actions
relied on the collusion of local of‹cials, including the Landrat in Saarbrücken, local mayors, and the police, who effectively suppressed the
speech of ARV members by invoking the Prussian law of association, routinely harassed its members and leaders, pressured local publicans to deny
their meetings rooms to the ARV, and gave local industrialists membership lists and other information about association members.26 By the fall
of 1890, Saar employers and their local allies had all but destroyed the
organization; the widespread defection of members over the winter of
1890–91 had taken its toll by the time Roll chaired the ARV’s last meeting
in Ensdorf in early May 1891.27

Saar Miners and Proletarian Öffentlichkeit
Saar miners were able to sustain their movement until 1893 by fashioning
the institutions and deliberative practices of what might be called a proletarian public sphere. They did this in several ways. First, they created parallel institutions of discursive interaction alongside existing bourgeois
institutions. In response to local efforts to suppress their meetings,
Rechtsschutzverein leaders began construction of their own building in
Bildstock in February 1891. In April 1891, they also began to publish their
own press organ, independent of the of‹cial Bergmannsfreund of the Saar
Mining Of‹ce, under the title Schlegel und Eisen.28 Most striking, during
the fall and winter of 1889, Rechtsschutzverein activists formed their own
electoral committees in the region and subsequently ‹nanced their own
(unsuccessful) candidates for the February 1890 Reichstag elections:
Warken ran in the district of Saarbrücken, and miner and Rechtsschutzverein deputy chairman Matthias Bachmann ran in Ottweiler and
Saarlouis.29 Second, Saar miners integrated the deliberative norms and
institutions of the bourgeois-liberal public sphere with alternative popular
institutions, political expression, and participatory forms of democratic
practice. Rechtsschutzverein meetings were organized and scheduled by
local trustees, but the process of debate and decision making in the organization involved the steady input of the rank-and-‹le membership. In

Challenges to Paternalism

87

addition, during the summer of 1890, the miners began to form their own
drinking clubs (Casinos) or cooperatives, which dispensed beer and
schnapps, as a way of creating public spaces that were not subject to the
Prussian association law and thus escaped police surveillance. Combining
existing forms of working-class sociability with political aims, most of the
over 160 miners’ casinos that were created by 1893 were led by local
trustees of the Rechtsschutzverein and included many strikers who had
been dismissed by the Mining Of‹ce.30 Third, Saar miners evolved forms
of self-assertion that combined organization with direct action and
“rough” and “physical” speech. As a means of preventing employers from
preparing for a strike and of building solidarity, they rejected the carefully
planned and calculated strike and the legal requirement that they inform
their employer, fourteen days in advance, of their intention to strike. “The
breakout of the strike,” Warken explained, “does not threaten to destroy
the organization; rather the strike is the fount [Schöpfer] of organization.
A strike, if it is going to be effective, must break in like a thief in the
night.”31 As mining of‹cials began to sack Rechtsschutzverein leaders and
members, employ strikebreakers during strikes, and call on local gendarmes and military units to police the mines, Saar miners turned to intimidation by means of name-calling, insult, and physical violence as forms of
collective self-defense. From 1889 to 1893, miners and their family members were often arrested for calling mining foremen “rogues” (Spitzbuben),
factory owners “sycophants,” and strikebreakers “pit rags”; and the leaders of the Rechtsschutzverein and ARV were repeatedly arrested—
Warken was convicted on a total of thirty-four separate charges and spent
thirty-two months in prison during this period—for “incitement” to violence or “class hatred,” “disturbing the peace,” “provocative speeches,”
“disrespectful expressions,” slander, and lèse-majesté, often at the mere
mention of the kaiser’s name during meetings.32 Not surprisingly, direct
physical confrontations between miners and strikebreakers began to take
place as early as the December strike of 1889, when strikers at the Heinitz,
Dechen, and Gerhard collieries intervened to prevent the distribution of
lamps, the roll call, and other miners from descending into the pits.33
Fourth, over time, the miners began to formulate their interests and
public demands in distinctively collective and class terms. This was visible
in the regionwide attempts to establish connections with and to assist
other miners in the Forbach district of neighboring Lorraine and the
Bavarian Palatinate from November 1889 to May 1890, workers at the privately owned coking plants in Hirchsbach and Altenwald from March to

88

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

May 1890, and the workers in other Saar heavy industries during the summer of 1890. It was perhaps even more visible in the connections they
established with Ruhr miners beginning in September 1889, when a delegation of Saar miners attended the ‹rst national German miners’ assembly
in Halle; in November, when Warken and others went to the Ruhr to coordinate strategy with striking miners to the north; and in February 1891,
when they sent a similar group to the meeting of Ruhr miners’ delegates in
Bochum, where they met with the leaders of the socialist Alter Verband
and the Christian organization “Glückauf” and agreed on a common set
of workplace demands. In April 1891, Rechtsschutzverein leaders began
making international contacts by sending a delegation to the international
miners’ congress in Paris, which included representatives from miners’
organizations in France, Belgium, Austria, and Britain and focused on
developing common strategies—strategies that prompted Saar miners to
demand that the Mining Of‹ce cease all shipments of coal to the striking
regions of the Ruhr in May 1891.34 In this context, as Horst Steffens
argues, Saar miners began to rearticulate their early and “respectful”
appeals to established authorities into a class language criticizing “coal
barons,” “capitalists,” and the greedy “Bourgeoisie.”35 Their growing
recognition of themselves as miners in opposition to mining of‹cials and
their attempts to build solidarity with other miners and workers in the
region were revealed as well in the everyday language and symbolism of
the Saar miners’ movement, in local May Day celebrations, and in the
growing interest in social democracy among some of the members of the
Rechtsschutzverein, including the editor of Schlegel und Eisen.36
Finally, Saar miners contravened the gendered divisions and strictures of the bourgeois public sphere—a feature of proletarian
Öffentlichkeit dramatized by the massive winter strike of 1893. In response
to dramatic wage reductions and the introduction of a new set of work
rules that failed to meet the Rechtsschutzverein’s earlier demands, several
thousand miners met in Bildstock in early December and voted to strike
on 1 January, an action that began with formal noti‹cation and a petition
to commerce minister Hans von Berlepsch and the kaiser but quickly
evolved into a wider struggle that drew on solidarities forged in Saar mining communities, direct collective actions, and embodied or “physical
speech” (Körpersprache), in which the body, physical gestures, and violence became a direct means of interest representation.37 The winter strike
was bitterly contested in the pits, in the streets, at the railroad stations, on
the paths leading to the collieries, and in ‹elds and open clearings near the

Challenges to Paternalism

89

mines. Striking miners came into direct and violent con›ict with the local
gendarmes and blackleg labor: attempts by police to close down meetings,
break up pickets, and arrest leaders of the Rechtsschutzverein led to
armed crowd actions aimed at securing the release of fellow strikers. In
response to of‹cial intervention and coercion, the miners broke windows
in the homes of “offending” mining of‹cials and those miners who refused
to leave the pits; threatening posters were tacked to local buildings and
trees, dynamite charges were set before the house doors of opponents, and
the revolver became a weapon of intimidation.38 Most striking was the
involvement of entire families, especially women, in the con›ict. While a
sexual division of tasks was discernible in most of the strike activities of
men and women, the miners’ wives were nonetheless engaged in distinctly
“unfeminine” behavior: they and their children were most responsible for
ostracizing and “shaming” potential strikebreakers through insult and
intimidation. Women also spat on opponents and were identi‹ed with the
growing violence; they marched in processions, apparently carried their
own revolvers, and broke the windows of strikebreakers’ homes.39 Moreover, during this particular strike, women became “public” in new ways.
As early as 1 January 1893, miners’ wives were participating in strike meetings, encouraging their husbands to continue the con›ict. On 2 January,
however, the women themselves organized and conducted a meeting for
“wives of the striking miners,” the ‹rst of several meetings during the ‹rst
week of January. On 5 January, the high point of women’s public mobilization, some ten thousand protestors converged on a packed assembly
hall in Bildstock. According to local papers, while their husbands mingled
in the streets outside, women spoke about the importance of the strike and
solidarity “until they were hoarse.”40 The general radicalization of the
miners’ wives prompted extreme reactions from local mining of‹cials and
bourgeois liberals, who denounced the women protestors as the “purest of
shrews,” whose “nasty and fanatical manner” exceeded that of the men in
the “savagery of their views and speech.”41
In view of the fact that the miners and their family members had decisively abandoned the path of gradualist proceduralism characteristic of
the bourgeois public sphere and had subverted its constitutive separation
from the spheres of production and reproduction, it is not surprising that
mining of‹cials in Saarbrücken and Bonn and regional and local state
of‹cials—with the strong support of local private industry—agreed to
break the strike and the Rechtsschutzverein with mass dismissals on 9 January. Accordingly, they sacked some ‹ve hundred “principal agitators”

90

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

and laid off an additional two to three thousand miners. In part because
such measures technically did not ban the miners from joining the
Rechtsschutzverein and therefore restrict their legal right to organize,
long-standing opponents of the miners’ organization were also joined by
many who were at least partially sympathetic to the miners’ cause in the
past: most notably, Berlepsch and the reform parties in the Reichstag (the
left-liberal Progressives and the Center). Only the SPD defended the miners. In the wake of dismissals and arrests, the strike unraveled, and the
miners’ movement was weakened by a massive wave of defections by late
January. A new cohort of less militant leaders then voted down the leadership of the Rechtsschutzverein, especially those who were receptive to
the SPD, and assumed control over the organization. When Peter Schillo,
a Catholic hostile to the SPD and the radical elements in the Rechtsschutzverein, took over for Warken in mid-March 1893, he changed the
overall orientation and tactics of the organization. Schillo promised to
return to the “original” purposes of the Rechtsschutzverein and strict
adherence to the pursuit of the “just demands” of the miners “by means of
the presentation of well-founded petitions before the appropriate legal
entities”—a return to the studied gradualism of bourgeois Öffentlichkeit.42
The radical reorganization of the miners’ organization and its subsequent
reliance on petitions, which were sent to the Reichstag and the Prussian
Landtag but were never answered, failed to save the Rechtsschutzverein.
By the end of 1893, nearly all members had given up their membership.43

Catholic Social Reform
In response to the radicalization of the miners’ Rechtsschutzverein and its
distinctively proletarian forms of self-assertion and subversion of the gender hierarchies of bourgeois Öffentlichkeit, Catholic clergymen and politicians like Georg Dasbach turned to a new strategy of social reform for the
purpose of immunizing Saar workers against socialist and even independent politics after 1890: the active mobilization of working-class loyalties
by means of new organizations, the Catholic Volksverein and the Saar
miners’ and factory workers’ associations. These initiatives were conceived in the context of the New Course legislation of Berlepsch, along
with the support offered in the kaiser’s February Decrees and Pope Leo
XIII’s May 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, which represented an of‹cial
papal attempt to respond to the deleterious consequences of economic and

social transformation by authorizing the formation of “workers’ associations” for the purpose of providing religious instruction and social support
to workers and fostering a “healthy relationship between workers and
employers in regard to rights and duties.”44 But it was mainly Center
politicians and Catholic reformers within Germany, rather than of‹cials
of the church hierarchy in Rome, who led efforts to create organizations
capable of pulling Catholics out of the siege mentality of the Kulturkampf
era and playing an active political role in defending the rights of Catholics
within the Protestant-dominated state, particularly in relation to workers
and the social question.45
Center Party leaders (namely, Ludwig Windhorst, Franz Brandts,
August Pieper, and Franz Hitze) conceived of the Volksverein as the
means by which to “school” Catholics “socially” in order to “re-Christianize” the social or to preserve the central institutions of a “Christian
social order”—religion, monarchy, family, and private property—as a
“bulwark against social democracy.”46 It would do this, as its leaders
openly maintained, by mobilizing support for the Center Party, but its
main purpose was to serve as a mass-based “propaganda association for
Christian social reform.” From this perspective, according to Center
politician Karl Trimborn, it was necessary to take “Christian social
truths” directly to the “communities and families.” “These times stand
under the sign of the social question,” he argued, and “would be negotiated not only in the parliaments but everywhere—in the factories, workshop, etc.”47 Organizers and activists of the Volksverein therefore
embraced a more determined approach to social reform, which advocated
more expansive social insurance measures and protective legislation for
workers and adopted more systematic and populist methods, including
general meetings, lectures, journals, and the mass distribution of
brochures and ›yers. This commitment resulted in impressive early gains
for the new organization: by the end of its ‹rst year of activity, the
Volksverein could already claim three hundred branch directors, 3,133
trustees, and 108,889 members throughout Germany.48 In the Saar, Georg
Dasbach, along with Center Party leaders Peter Döhmer, Dr. Strauss, and
Dr. Muth of St. Johann, the priest Bourgeois from St. Wendel, and the
priest Laven from Sulzbach, set up a regional of‹ce of the Volksverein in
February 1891. But only in August 1892, after Catholic leaders gave up on
transforming the Rechtsschutzverein from within, did the Volksverein set
down roots in the Saar and begin holding mass meetings, involving local
leaders and national ‹gures like Trimborn and Center Party Landtag del-

egate Ernst Lieber.49 In November, organizers set up a legal aid of‹ce, or
Volksbüro, which offered workers—and other Catholics—assistance in
matters related to civil law, including insurance, pension and Knappschaft
bene‹ts, workplace safety regulations, and taxes; by the spring of 1894, the
Volksverein’s membership had risen to roughly 2,200.50
Local leaders de‹ned the Volksverein in terms of a pastoral strategy
for reestablishing the social and political subordination of Saar miners by
denouncing their independent activism and Social Democratic sympathies
in a highly gendered discourse about working-class moral endangerment,
especially in relation to the working-class family.51 In the midst of the miners’ mobilization, Catholic priests met in March 1890 to discuss recent
developments and attributed what they regarded as the general lack of
“discipline” and declining respect for “spiritual and worldly authorities”
among Saar workers to a crisis of moral degeneration or “brutalization” in
local working-class communities, especially the unrestrained sexual license
between men and women that allegedly accompanied the rise of popular
entertainments (dances, shooting galleries, carousels, etc.) in the region.52
In August 1890, Dasbach similarly castigated the miners for making
demands on their employer, rather than politely asking for improvements
of their working conditions; called on the miners to accept their religiously
sanctioned subordination to their social superiors; and preached the values of “poverty, obedience, and sexual modesty,” as well as “self-denial”
in relation to “pleasure” and “earthly goods,” as the best means of establishing “peace” between workers and employers.53 Volksverein leaders,
determined to defend the “Christian social order” and “throne and alter,
home and hearth,” embraced this moral-religious explanation of labor
militancy and articulated their formal political demands to injunctions
about appropriately gendered role division within the working-class family, especially the roles of working-class women as wives and mothers and
the responsibilities of the “Catholic man” in the “Christian family.” This
explains their sense of urgency as they responded by means of a handbill
to articles in Schlegel und Eisen, the miners’ newspaper, in the spring of
1893: criticizing the attempt to turn Jesus into a socialist, the handbill condemned the articles for their contempt for private property and their
“attack on the Christian family,” a reference to an article in Schlegel und
Eisen supporting divorce in cases of failed marriages.54 In this way,
Volksverein leaders explicitly articulated together the electoral concerns of
the Center Party, social support initiatives for workers, and gendered
moral injunctions to “Catholic man” and woman in relation to workingclass families and everyday behavior.

Their efforts were buttressed by the new Catholic workers’ organizations established under the rubric of the Saar League of Catholic Miners’
and Factory Workers’ Associations in 1895. These groups were inspired by
discussions among leading Catholic reformers about the need to create
occupational organizations, rather than trade unions, for workers within
existing Catholic Vereine, in order to secure the in›uence of the Catholic
clergy and lay reformers over workers directly. They were conceived in the
context of a wide range of reform initiatives and drew on existing institutional connections and af‹liations, including the Volksverein and the Center Party, since the purpose of the league was not just to create new workers’ organizations but to link existing Catholic associations with mostly
working-class memberships under a single umbrella organization, as part
of a wider attempt at organizational concentration throughout the region.
Accordingly, in December 1894, Catholic priests and political leaders, in
their capacity as “presiding of‹cers of the Catholic-social organizations of
the Saar region,” announced their intention to create a new organization,
and on 3 February 1895, largely under the direction of Matthias Oesterling, the new league was called into being.55 By September 1895, its leaders
already reported a membership of ‹fty associations with 7,727 individual
members; after slow but steady growth, they claimed sixty-two associations with 9,372 members by 1899.56 Regular association meetings, communication among its leadership, and an annual league festival served to
coordinate its activities and commitments. The latter included modest
social programs, including sickness insurance supplements, ‹nancial support for funerals, savings accounts, and technical schooling. All of this
activity was organized and directed by Catholic clergymen—Oesterling
was the president of the league—and bourgeois laity on behalf of workers.
In this way, the miners’ and factory workers’ associations became
venues for local pastoral initiatives, which were designed to disseminate
and secure the ideological aims of Catholic social reform more effectively.
From the start, leaders of the new organization issued a public statement
to reassure the Mining Of‹ce and local employers that the league did not
constitute a “trade union in disguise,” which leaders of the Mining Of‹ce
publicly accepted. They emphasized its antisocialist intent by barring their
members from participation in Social Democratic activities.57 Rather,
their main goals were educative and cultural: they promised to “promote
the religious-moral life of, and the sincere harmony among,” their members; encourage intellectual development (Fortbildung), especially the
“correct understanding of matters related to” work or a trade; and represent the “material interests of the members with respect to the peaceful

94

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

relationships with employers and in consideration of the latter’s interests.”58 Toward these ends, the new associations offered a wide range of
programs and activities designed to shape the political subjectivities and
moral behavior of miners and factory workers, including regular and Sunday meetings, lectures, reading groups, choral and musical clubs, and festivals. Finally, much of this activity addressed the gendered concerns of
Catholic social reform directly: the involvement of working-class families
in many association events, especially outings and celebrations, and the
efforts to disseminate “healthy literature” were all part of the wider aim of
“ennobling family life” among the members.59
Despite their decidedly paternalist and hierarchical attitudes about
the moral de‹cits and political immaturity of workers, leaders of the
Volksverein and the Saar League of Catholic Miners’ and Factory Workers’ Associations adopted a reform logic that opened up a space of critique. The latter grew out of the populist orientation of the Catholic organizations. First, they appealed to all “estates”—“high and low, clergy and
laypersons, workers and employers”—in defense of “Christian society,
throne and altar, home and hearth,” which necessarily implied compromises from all directions. If workers were to remain obedient, employers
were expected to moderate their demands. In the ‹rst handbill from 1890,
leaders de‹ned the Volksverein as an organization that “wants to make
employers and employees more conscious of the obligation inherent in
their relationship to each other and pave the way for the recognition of a
community of interest among both sides.”60 Second, the emphasis on
active engagement with social reform implied some changes to the existing
paternalist regime. The new Catholic organizations sought not only “protection against false teaching” but also “the encouragement and active
pursuit of the correct principles in the social sphere.”61 This meant the
“promotion of social reform, so that the struggle against revolution would
take place on religious and social domains” and would be fought not with
police measures or “police batons” (Knüppelei) but with “practical social
reforms”—an orientation that challenged the directly coercive practices of
Saar industrialists.62 In this sense, the Volksverein and the Saar League of
Miners’ and Workers’ Associations could potentially become reformist
vehicles for Catholic workers dissatis‹ed with the labor and social policies
of local industrialists.63
Indeed, it was in the formal political sphere that Catholic reform initiatives posed the most direct threat to employer paternalism and its
defenders in the National Liberal and Free Conservative cartel. The

Challenges to Paternalism

95

Volksverein in particular was always understood as a mass-based organization with links to the Center Party. Leading national and local Center
politicians like Karl Trimborn, Carl Bachem, Eduard Fuchs, and Franz
Schädler were members of and took part in Volksverein meetings, called
on audiences to join the new organization and to support the Center Party,
and included the Volksverein in their strategic calculations for Landtag
and Reichstag elections.64 In addition, regional connections between leaders of the Volksverein of‹ce and the Saar League of Miners’ and Factory
Workers’ Associations were concentrated not only in the ‹gure of Oesterling but also in the wider social networks of Catholic organizations and
church of‹ces, especially with the support of Bishop Korum in Trier. This
general thickening of local Catholic organizational life became a cause of
concern for industrialists and their supporters in the National Liberal and
Free Conservative parties, in light of the Center’s growing electoral success in the Saar during the 1890s. In this context, the most serious challenge
posed by Catholic reform organizations was not their ability to transform
paternalist work relations in Saar heavy industry in any direct sense but
their wider threat to the electoral dominance of the ruling cartel parties,
which could have indirect consequences for local factory regimes. Center
Party victories would allow Center politicians to advocate for a range of
social welfare and labor protection measures that local industrialists
opposed—that is, to secure political leverage in the Landtag and Reichstag, institutions from which incursions into the paternalist industrial
workplace were possible.65 Partly this fear that Catholic reformers could
mobilize voters in support of the Center Party drove local Protestant liberals to experiment with their own versions of social reform.

Protestantism and Reform Liberalism
In response to the independent mobilization of the miners’ Rechtsschutzverein, the threat of social democracy, and the efforts of Catholic
priests and politicians like Dasbach to organize Saar workers, local reform
liberals and Christian Social Protestant clergymen also began to experiment with strategies for securing the paternalist aim of a “peaceful relationship between employer and employee.” This began in the fall of 1889,
primarily among adherents of the Christian Social movement within the
ranks of the local Protestant Bürgertum, in an effort to collapse the social
distance between bourgeois and worker and to generate “more feeling for

96

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

the people” among Protestant clergymen, liberal teachers and politicians,
and local artisans.66 Drawing on the experiences with the Protestant men
and boys’ clubs (Männer- und Jünglings-Vereine) of the 1860s and 1870s
and the model of Protestant workers’ associations in the Ruhr, Protestant
reform initiatives in the Saar expanded into a wider regional movement of
Protestant workers’ associations in response to the miners’ mobilizations
beginning in 1889. Local Protestant pastors and teachers created the ‹rst
association in October 1889 in Friedrichsthal, not coincidentally the seat
of the Rechtsschutzverein, and after one year, they consolidated their six
newly created organizations into the League of Protestant Workers’ Associations of the Saar (Verband Evangelischer Arbeitervereine an der
Saar).67 In the summer of 1893, the Saar league joined the German League
of Protestant Workers’ Associations (Gesamtverband evangelischer
Arbeitervereine Deutschlands), the nationwide umbrella organization
founded in August 1890 by Pastor L. Weber from Mönchengladbach and
encompassing six other regional leagues in Rhineland-Westphalia, central
Germany, Baden, the Palatinate, Württemberg, and Hesse.68 By 1900, the
Saar league comprised twenty-four associations with forty-one hundred
members and enjoyed the support of the Protestant League and the
Protestant newspaper in the region, the Evangelisches Wochenblatt (Evangelical Weekly).69
Aside from opposing the Rechtsschutzverein, the main ideological
goal of the Protestant workers’ associations was to combat political
Catholicism and Catholic reform initiatives and all socialist activity in the
region.70 In 1889, local Protestant clergymen traced the opposition within
the Rechtsschutzverein to their own efforts to organize Protestant workers
to the in›uence of “ultramontane agitators,” whose efforts to organize the
miners allegedly paved the way to “Social Democratic terror.”71 As Dasbach’s in›uence in the miners’ organization quickly waned, however, the
Rechsschutzverein was consistently associated only with the “tyranny” of
social democracy itself.72 The Reverend Adolf Fauth, a publicist for local
political Protestantism and a supporter of the new associations, began
publishing brochures about the dangers of social democracy in 1890 and,
like other leaders, explicitly de‹ned the confessional organizations as the
necessary means by which to promote the “moral-religious regeneration of
the entire life of our people” and to “master the terrifying forces of revolution.”73 The main goals of the new associations therefore combined religious, moral, and political concerns: they included the propagation of
Protestant beliefs and national loyalties, the cultivation of a “Christian

Challenges to Paternalism

97

family life,” the promotion of “moral elevation and general education,”
the maintenance of a “peaceful relationship between employer and
employee,” and the provision of social support in cases of need.74
The overall “antiultramontane” and antisocialist mission of the
Protestant workers’ associations was to come in a putatively nonpolitical
program of “education” (Bildung) or “enlightenment” (Aufklärung)—in
the words of the Reverend Nold, a “spiritual and moral, political and
social, German-national education”—involving a combination of religious moralizing, patriotic propaganda, and paternalist pedagogy in a
wide array of ideological initiatives after 1890. Association leaders offered
a richly textured associational life, realized in regular monthly or weekly
meetings and periodic regional conferences, political and historical lectures and presentations, religious instruction and Bible study, poetry and
literature readings, photographic exhibits, tableaux vivants, theatrical and
musical performances, youth sections and activities, and family outings
and celebrations. The League of Protestant Worker’s Associations also
established a small library in Ludweiler, in conjunction with the national
Association for Christian Popular Education, which disseminated appropriate reading materials in the form of books, novels, magazines, newspapers, calendars, and brochures on a wide range of subjects, ranging
from natural science to history. Various kinds of family entertainments,
such as the Festspiele [plays], with titles like “Luther’s Four Days in
Frankfurt,” “The Kaiser’s Dream of Destiny,” or “Bismarck as German
Defender,” reinforced antisocialist and nationalist themes but also provided lessons on a wide array of “moral” concerns related to workers and
their families.75
This focus on “morals” was most clearly revealed in efforts to promote a “Christian family life,” one of the ‹ve formal goals of the movement, which rested on explicitly gendered claims about the importance of
bourgeois familial order, particularly the moralizing in›uences of women,
as the key to containing working-class radicalism. In his antisocialist pamphlet from 1890, the Protestant reformer Adolf Fauth described Social
Democrats as lazy and dangerous “destroyers of the people” (Volksverderber), who lured workers into a life centered only on the “enjoyment of all
earthly pleasures,” including “dances, theater, smoking clubs, and so on,”
and thus routinely “undermine domestic happiness.” Socialist visions of
sexual equality and collective child care, Fauth maintained, led to the
obliteration of the “Christian family” and the “orderly household.” The
“good Christian wife” was responsible for preventing this state of affairs.

98

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Diligently she goes about her work from early morning to the
evening, and not a single penny of his [the husband’s] wage is spent on
unnecessary things; she has nothing to do with ‹nery and knickknacks; when he comes home from his shift, he ‹nds a simple but
tastily prepared meal on the table; it is clean in the living and bed
rooms and everything is in good order; the children are obedient and
are raised as Christian; they do not cause him any heartache. In this
manner, he does not become a tavern brother, but prefers to spend his
time at home with his wife and child, where he feels homebound and
safe.76
By contrast, the working-class woman who lacked domestic skills,
indulged in “pleasure-loving” (vergnügungslustig) pursuits, and was
“obsessed with dressing up” would, according to Protestant workers’ association leader Zarth, cancel the bene‹cial effects of welfare reforms and
contribute directly to the political radicalization of her husband.77 These
concerns were taken up in a new series in the Evangelical Weekly entitled
“Contributions to the Solution of the Social Question” beginning in 1889,
during the miners’ mobilization; and they were addressed regularly in the
activities and programmatic statements of the movement.78 Association
lectures focused on such themes as the virtues of hard work, moderate
drinking (and the dangers of alcoholism), and the blessings of a properly
ordered family life. Even theatrical presentations, with titles like “Ideal
Women Figures of the House of Hohenzollern,” included educational
content of this kind.79
These gendered concerns were not incidental but, rather, central to
the political project of Protestant workers’ association leaders, because
they embraced assumptions about bourgeois acculturation as a precondition for political speech and worked to secure liberal de‹nitions of citizenship and rights, “reasonable” demands for reform, and the boundaries of
permissible debate among Saar workers. Association leaders began with
the important recognition that workers could no longer be treated as
objects of (paternalist) benevolence and tutelage in the age of compulsory
education and mass politics. Local reformer and teacher Strunk spoke at
the third annual league festival of the Protestant workers’ associations
about the dangers of social democracy: “The German worker is not the
slave who must break his chains . . . the German worker is in every way a
citizen endowed with equal rights and equal respect who is entitled to have
his wishes and demands considered.”80 This emphasis on legal rights and

Challenges to Paternalism

99

citizenship was directly linked to proceduralist assumptions about gradual
social reform. It was in this sense that Pastor Coerper, another leader of
the Protestant workers’ movement, argued that the “conditions of our
workers need, and are capable of, signi‹cant development” and that “here
is an area in which the rich fruit of justice [Gerechtigkeit]—for example,
more secure legal rights, improved economic situation, and a more
respected social position and treatment—must be sown and harvested.”81
But association leaders always quali‹ed the exercise of citizenship rights
with warnings about more radical political designs. “Nothing really productive,” Strunk admonished, “can be gained by way of revolution, however; only on the legal path of well-ordered legislation. Achieving the goals
that guarantee citizens satisfaction by way of the legal route is the determined will of the German people and the kaiser.”82 Thus the purpose of
the new organizations was not simply to allow workers access to public
debate but to reform and channel their political speech and participation
into “appropriate” and permissible expressions. Workers, according to
Zarth, could be treated as full citizens only after a concerted effort of
social reform had offered them the “opportunity to increase their knowledge in an appropriate and purposeful way” and had eliminated dangerous “half-knowledge” or “misunderstood truth.” This general program of
reform and education would have many bene‹ts for workers, he argued,
if, for example, they learn here the costs, the terrible misery of revolutions for a people; if they are shown by means of historical conditions
that workers today fare much better than in the past; if they hear how
economic activity has gradually developed, how in their very existence and prosperity, trade, industry, artisanal production, and agriculture are fundamentally interdependent.83
The purpose of the Protestant workers’ associations was therefore to cultivate the “private” subjectivities and reform the morals of workers in
order to render them as “mature” public citizens, who would make limited
political claims and not demand fundamental social changes, as a precondition for their entry into local Öffentlichkeit.
Nevertheless, this version of reform contained important, if initially
latent, elements of opposition to the paternalist labor regime of the Saar.
Whereas local industrialists supported the organizations before 1893, they
increasingly grew concerned about the emphasis on citizenship and associational rights and the growing presence of Friedrich Naumann’s reform

100

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

ideas in the associations. Indeed, in the summer of 1893, leaders of the Saar
associations were drifting toward the reform group around Naumann and
not the conservative faction led by L. Weber in the German League of
Protestant Workers’ Associations. This became obvious with the publication and local circulation of the Naummanite Reform Program, which
addressed conditions speci‹c to the “large-scale factory” and promised to
support “workers in their striving for the elevation and improvement of
their living situations.” The six-point program called for the inclusion of
widows and orphans in state social insurance programs, limitations on
women’s and children’s paid employment, the introduction of legally recognized occupational associations or trade unions, the protection of the
worker’s right to organize, the introduction of workers’ representatives
and representative bodies in individual factories, and the transformation
of state enterprises into “model factories” in a “worker-friendly sense,”
involving the “guarantee of the full personal freedom of the workers and
white collar employees.”84
This same Protestant-liberal version of social reform was winning
adherents among the members of the Artisans’ Association in Saarbrücken, many of whom were also involved in the Protestant workers’
associations. Originally created in 1864 as an occupational association
dedicated to the “intellectual and material well-being of the artisan
estate,” the Artisans’ Association expanded in the late 1880s and early
1890s to encompass a more socially diverse membership.85 By 1895, the
association, led by the gymnasium teacher Dr. Theodor Meyer, had
changed its name to Artisans’ Association—Association for Popular Education [Handwerker Verein für Volksbildung] and had altered its statutes
to re›ect its new general mission: the “promotion of intellectual and moral
education.” Henceforth, the Artisans’ Association would sponsor lectures
for the general public on “all spheres of knowledge,” with the speci‹cation
that the lectures were to “be generally interesting” and “must not have
party-political or confessional points of controversy as their focus.”86 In
addition to public lectures, it held regular meetings, built its own library,
and sponsored celebrations and family events. This transformation into an
association for public lectures and general forum of local conviviality or
sociability (gesellige Unterhaltung) dramatically increased the size of the
Artisans’ Association: from 1893 to 1896, its membership rose from about
‹ve hundred to eleven hundred.87
It also re›ected the growing popularity of lectures related to matters
of general interest and social reform among the members of the associa-

Challenges to Paternalism

101

tion. Each year, leaders of the Artisans’ Association invited prominent
academics, artists, and public ‹gures—like the sociologist Max Weber, the
poet Emil Rittershaus, and the historian Hermann Oncken—to deliver
public lectures, but they also began to invite several leading advocates of
social reform, including the economist Adolph Wagner, the social
reformer and women’s rights advocate Elisabeth Gnauk-Kühne, and
Friedrich Naumann. The most publicized talk was Naumann’s lecture
entitled “Indigence, Charity, and Self-Help Organizations,” delivered on 4
October 1894, which called for the comprehensive public organization of
poor relief as well as self-help organizations, including trade unions, for all
occupational groups, as solutions to the problem of poverty.88 Less than a
year later, Adolph Wagner delivered a lecture entitled “Socialism, Social
Democracy, and Positive Social Reform,” which addressed some similar
themes to an audience of about six hundred people. Rejecting attempts,
especially on the part of employer-paternalists like Stumm, to equate the
social reform advocacy of some academics with socialism, Wagner insisted
that academic reformers proposed many different solutions to the social
question, including trade unions of the British kind, self-help cooperatives,
protective legislation, and state ownership of essential industries.89 This
advocacy of nonsocialist trade unions was tied explicitly to the gendered
imperative to reform the subjectivities and “private lives” of industrial
workers as a precondition for granting them the right to participate in the
public sphere—a project developed further in two subsequent association
lectures, delivered by Naumann and Elisabeth Gnauk-Kühne in October
1895 and November 1895, respectively.90

The “War between the Patriots”: The Crisis within the LiberalConservative Coalition
The new Christian Social orientation within the Protestant-liberal establishment led to intense political con›ict between its local supporters and
opponents from 1895 to 1898. These disagreements became public in February 1895, when Stumm, Vopelius, and Röchling delivered a warning to
the leaders of the Protestant associations about their reform activities,
especially the formation of a legal aid bureau in the fall of 1894 and the distribution of Friedrich Naumann’s new journal Die Hilfe in the associations. Begun as an informal offer of legal advice to workers as a means of
reducing the potential of the Rechtsschutzverein-led strike in early 1891,

102

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

the legal aid bureau evolved into a formal of‹ce from August to November 1894, when Protestant Workers’ League leaders felt the need to create
an organization capable of preventing Protestant workers from using the
services of the Catholic Volksverein. The bureau offered workers assistance not only in matters related to sickness, accident, old age and disability insurance, poor relief, taxation, schooling, military service, guardianship, and ‹re insurance but also in other “matters related to the labor
relationship.”91 At the same time, several of the leaders of the movement
in the Saar were embracing the ideas of the Naumann wing of the German
League of Protestant Workers’ Associations and distributing copies of
Naumann’s brochures to the local associations.92 This activity coincided
with a development even more threatening to local industrialists: Naumann’s aforementioned visit to the Artisans’ Association in Saarbrücken
on 4 October 1894, during which he addressed the topic of independent
labor organizations.
Stumm’s response to these reformist “intrusions” into the Saar began
with his national efforts in the Reichstag to silence Social Democrats by
means of exceptional legislation in the winter and spring of 1894–95. During the Reichstag debate over the imperial government’s proposed AntiRevolution Bill, which was designed to curb the “in›ammatory speech” of
Social Democrats via amendments and supplements to the criminal and
military codes and the press laws, Stumm pushed for draconian measures
against Social Democrats, including the denial of their “active and passive
right to vote” and the punishment of exile or imprisonment of all socialist
“agitators.” During his 9 January speech, Stumm also criticized academic
and religious reformers, attacking what he described as “university socialism” and the dangerous precedent set by Protestant clergymen—that is,
the Christian Socials—who “›irted” with the doctrines of social democracy and revolution.93 Whereas the “socialists of the chair” were gaining a
dangerous in›uence over higher education but at least speaking to “educated audiences,” Stumm complained, pastors like Friedrich Naumann
agitated among simple workers and spread “dissatisfaction”; they thereby
risked turning the Protestant workers’ associations into “combative organizations” that would “march directly into the camp of social democracy.”
Stumm’s comments unleashed a storm of criticism from the ranks of social
reformers and Christian Socials, especially Adolph Wagner, who called
the remarks “irresponsible assertions” and defended the nationalist,
monarchist, and capitalist commitments of the so-called socialists of the
chair. The controversy was fought out in the pages of Die Hilfe and Die

Challenges to Paternalism

103

Post, and Stumm even went so far as to challenge Wagner to a duel.94 In
the end, however, Stumm did not prevail in the Reichstag, and the last version of the bill, which Stumm himself did not support because it did not go
far enough in its restrictions on political speech, went down to defeat in
May 1895.
In contrast to this lack of success at the national level, Stumm and his
allies, who passed a resolution in support of Stumm during the Reichstag
debate, were able to contain, at least in the short term, the activities of
bourgeois and Protestant reformers in the Saar.95 Here, where the immediate occasion for open controversy was Naumann’s lecture to the Artisans’ Association on 24 October 1895, the matter was more susceptible to
the time-tested practices of coercion and inside in›uence. In addition to
silencing local newspapers that printed articles favorable to Naumann by
threatening to withdraw his ‹nancial support, Stumm pressured upperlevel provincial school authorities in Koblenz, via the agency of Oberpräsident Nasse, after which Dr. Mirisch, director of the Oberrealschule,
discussed the matter with Theodor Meyer, who tendered his resignation as
chairman of the Artisans’ Association in May 1896.96 Stumm also engineered the removal of two reformist teachers, Dr. Görbig and Dr. Disselnkötter, from their posts at the gymnasium and their transfer out of the
region in February 1896.97 Not satis‹ed with the extent of the local purge,
Stumm, Karl Röchling, Richard Vopelius, and Rudolf Böcking, director
of the Hallberg steelworks, attempted to secure the transfer of the director
of the gymnasium, Dr. Fischer, whom they suspected of protecting Naumannites within the faculty. They attempted to replace Fischer with Dr.
Scheer, a Stumm supporter and teacher at the gymnasium, though the
industrialists ultimately failed to prevail in this case.98
At the same time, Stumm moved against local leaders of the Saar
League of Protestant Workers’ Associations. In November 1895, he pressured the reform pastors, who met for their delegates conference on 10
November and both distanced the Saar league from Naumann’s reform
activities and reaf‹rmed its commitment to cultivating a “peaceful relationship between workers and employers” and its opposition to social
democracy.99 In view of this ambivalence, Stumm and other Saar industrialists stepped up their attacks on the Protestant clergy in January and February 1896, calling the Christian Social movement a “revolutionary phenomenon dangerous to the public weal” and calling its leaders “conscious
or unconscious ‘helper’s helpers’ of social revolution who stand on the
same step with Bebel and Liebknecht.”100 After twenty-nine local clergy-

104

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

men issued a public declaration defending their movement in response to
these articles, Stumm attacked as dangerous reformers Lentze; Pastor von
Scheven, editor of the Evangelical Weekly, which Stumm ultimately
banned from his factory grounds and welfare facilities in Neunkirchen;
and Superintendent Zillessen of St. Arnual. This public accusation
prompted the overwhelming majority of Protestant clergymen of the district synod to pass a resolution in favor of Zillessen and the “social activities” of the pastors, as a vital part of their “spiritual of‹ce,” as well as the
publication of a brochure entitled Freiherr von Stumm-Halberg und die
evangelischen Geistlichen im Saargebiet, written in defense of the Protestant leaders of the associations.101 Stumm then attempted to pressure
of‹cials of the Rhine consistory in Koblenz to initiate disciplinary measures against the offending clergymen and the transfer of Zillessen, Lentze,
and von Scheven out of the region.102 Despite other, similar attempts to
use his money and in›uence—including efforts to have orders conferred
on two “loyal” pastors, to pressure the Neunkirchen presbytery into petitioning the Koblenz consistory, to create and ‹nance a new opening for a
pastor locally, and to petition the Oberkirchenrat [Supreme Consistory] in
Berlin in order to demand transfers or disciplinary actions—Stumm was
unable to have his way in this case.103
These actions ultimately generated a regionwide political con›ict over
social reform and the worker question, dubbed the “War between the
Patriots,” which produced a split in the dominant paternalist-liberal consensus and the local “public.” The debate between reformers and paternalist industrialists sent reverberations throughout the principal institutions of the local Protestant Bürgertum. In April 1896, it entered the
“nonpolitical” meeting rooms of the Saarbrücker Casino, the elite social
club, when Ewald Hilger was discussing these matters with reform-minded
members: “We would have forced out your Meyer, if we had been able to,”
he reportedly claimed.104 It also entered the “nonpolitical” halls of the
gymnasium, where it divided the proponents of Protestant-liberal reform
from the supporters of the industrialists within the local educational establishment. Here the faculty was apparently almost evenly split between a
reform faction of eight members, including Director Fischer, who had
formed an evening discussion group in order to discuss social issues, and a
conservative group, led by Dr. Herwig and Dr. Scheer, comprising nine
members who supported Stumm and his allies.105
More serious, the Saarbrücker Zeitung, the central medium of local
Öffentlichkeit and the long-standing venue of paternalist interests, became

Challenges to Paternalism

105

the site of political contestation as local industrialists targeted its coverage
of Christian Social views and activities as well as the reform sympathies of
its editor Albert Zühlke.106 Indeed, during the course of the con›ict over
the Artisans’ Association and the Protestant Workers’ Associations, the
Saarbrücker Zeitung had become a leading voice of opposition to Stumm
and his allies and even openly challenged the “Stumm system”—“a system,” it asserted, “that renders impossible all debate and criticism by
means of coercive measures and that wants to suppress all free expression
of opinion.”107 In the spring of 1896, the industrialist Karl Karcher and a
committee of ‹ve self-appointed representatives from the “middle parties”—Boltz, Olzem, Vopelius, Kommerzienrat Haldy from St. Johann,
and Hilger of the Mining Of‹ce—contacted the Saarbrücker Zeitung’s
owner and publisher, Carl Hofer, to begin negotiations in an unsuccessful
attempt to effect a change of editorial direction. The committee offered an
annual subvention of ten thousand marks in return for the removal of
Zühlke as editor and his replacement with a new editor favorable to the
interests of heavy industry.108 Thwarted, the committee of ‹ve proceeded,
with Stumm’s backing, to arrange for the purchase of the General
Anzeiger, a local newspaper in St. Johann with no clear party pro‹le and a
small readership. Negotiations with a Strasbourg publisher produced an
agreement by which the latter would purchase the General Anzeiger and
receive a subvention of one hundred thousand marks over a period of ten
years. The ‹ve-member committee would exercise “oversight” authority in
order to ensure the new paper’s adherence to the political line set by the
industrialist wing of the National Liberal and Free Conservative cartel.109
After a direct ‹nancial threat, the previous publisher-editor sold the General Anzeiger, and the Neue Saarbrücker Zeitung, a newspaper published
in the “grand style” and representing the interest of local heavy industry,
was of‹cially established.110 In order to guarantee ‹nancial support for the
new press organ while at the same time denying support to the Saarbrücker Zeitung, Stumm led a campaign to transfer to the new publisher all
sources of revenue and advertising from the Saar Chamber of Commerce,
the Iron and Steel Occupational Association [Berufsgenossenschaft], the
companies belonging to the SGVDESI and the VWGWISI, the Mining
Of‹ce, and local state agencies—the railroad administration, the post
of‹ce, the tax assessment and forestry of‹ces, the courts, and the city
administrations of Saarbrücken and St. Johann.
Despite this success, the actions of Stumm and his allies exposed the
workings of power and economic in›uence in the arena of public debate—

106

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

a violation of the authorizing strategies and necessary discursive evasions
of bourgeois Öffentlichkeit—and thus opened up latent ideological divisions within the local “citizenry” or “public,” with far-reaching consequences for the National Liberal Party in the region. When the paternalist
leadership of the party negotiated the newspaper deal and called a meeting
for 1 March in order to con‹rm the Neue Saarbrücker Zeitung as the
of‹cial party newspaper and to declare the Christian Social movement
incompatible with National Liberalism, it necessarily turned the debate
over social reform and the “worker question” into a con›ict within the
local National Liberal Party itself.111 The crassness of these kinds of
actions, which were routinely employed against workers but generally
obscured by the apoliticism of liberal discourse, drew an immediate
rebuke from the reformist members of the National Liberal Party. In the
meeting, Mirisch, speaking on behalf of the reformist opposition, condemned the attacks on supporters of Naumann by means of “coercion,”
rather than verbal persuasion, as a violation of the “free expression” of liberal voters. He also criticized the attempt to buy the editors of the Saarbrücker Zeitung, for its reduction of political conviction to a salable commodity.112 A week later, during the ‹rst meeting of the reform opposition
within the party, the pastor Coerper referred to the Neue Saarbrücker
Zeitung as the “Stumm organ,” implicitly redescribing it as a private publication representing the views of the one man who ‹nanced it, rather than
a public institution with a wider appeal among the citizenry. This meeting
consisted of over seven hundred reform-minded liberal voters, which also
included Mirisch, the gymnasium teacher Krämer, the editor Zühlke, and
the Reverend Zillessen, who rejected the inauguration of the new newspaper and the actions of the industrialist wing of the party; they ended the
meeting with a salute to the “free citizenry.”113 Boltz and the industrialist
wing of the party called the next meeting for mid-April in order to seek
“clari‹cation and reconciliation” and expel all Christian Social in›uences
from the party. In response, the reformers not only criticized “heavyhanded” paternalist responses to workers’ organizations and called for a
new approach to the “worker question”; they also rejected the attempts to
render reformers from their own ranks “voiceless,” Boltz’s support for the
Anti-Revolution Bill, and his more immediate effort to control the discussion agenda of the meeting. In a moment of political self-re›exivity, the
reformers even drew parallels between this treatment and the paternalist
domination of workers. “The delegates,” Kriene argued, “would not allow
the citizenry [Bürgertum] to speak in their meeting because they view the

Challenges to Paternalism

107

latter like they view the proletariat, members of which during election time
are addressed as ‘dear gentlemen’ and ‘esteemed assembly’ but afterward
are held in contempt or, more often, simply not even considered and only
expected to remain silent.”114 The efforts of reformers to hold more protest
meetings, draw up petitions to higher state authorities, and mobilize their
supporters in open rejection of paternalist control over local party politics
ultimately threatened to split apart the National Liberal Party organization in the region.
These disagreements were framed in terms of a battle over control of
the local citizenry and the “public.” The reform faction laid claim to the
title of “National Liberal citizen’s party,” acting, in the words of the shopkeeper Ruhr, in defense of the “independence of the citizens.”115 As general citizens and members of the “citizen’s party,” as the reformers put it in
their 8 March meeting, they raised their “utmost objection to the suppression of free expression, to the politics of coercion.”116 In this way, the
reformers counterposed themselves to the “Halberg party” and invoked
the general “public” in a way that tried to reclaim the ground of a uni‹ed
and “free citizenry” demanding the right to “free expression.” In addition,
they rejected the way in which this “public” was excluded from the decisions made over the creation of a new newspaper; and, outraged by the
transfer of the teachers as an unwarranted intervention of the state into
affairs of the citizenry, they petitioned state of‹cials and even the kaiser in
support of Dr. Meyer. The “independence and trustworthiness of state
of‹cials” was explicitly called into question, as were the attempts to
restrict the legal rights and political freedoms of the teachers and the
broader public.117 Much in the way it usually served to particularize workers, this rhetorical strategy was now deployed to exclude the paternalist
faction of the party from the liberal consensus.
Stumm and his allies in the party leaderships also spoke to and
invoked the name of the public. When it appeared that state of‹cials
would refuse to allow the Mining Of‹ce to transfer the business of the
Bergmannsfreund to the new newspaper, Stumm wrote to Oberpräsident
Nasse and claimed that the Neue Saarbrücker Zeitung would necessarily
appear to be “boycotted in the eyes of the entire public because everyone
knows that the promises were made.” “Under these conditions,” he
asserted, “neutrality really amounts to opposition to the ‘middle parties’
and support for the Christian Socials.”118 Stumm added, “The entire mining population will view this as a change of policy against the new press
organ, and the latter must, therefore, appear without backing. If that is the

108

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

case, our ‹ght in the Saar is simply lost and the pastors have won the
game.”119 Indeed, local industrialists and their allies in the National Liberal Party leadership de‹ned their party meetings during the spring of 1896
as “public” demonstrations designed for the purpose of responding to the
alleged falsehoods of the reformist opposition, which had unsettled “public opinion” and threatened to turn it against the well-intentioned policies
of the industrialist faction of the party.120
This con›ict over social reform, the competition over the de‹nitions
and the sympathies of the local citizenry or public, and the struggle over
the boundaries of permissible speech threatened to weaken the National
Liberal Party during the Reichstag elections of 1898. The reform faction,
now coalesced into the “liberal citizens’ party,” held a meeting at the end
of May 1897 in order to criticize the current National Liberal leadership
and its support for the Anti-Revolution Bill and for a bill proposed before
the Prussian Landtag and calling for restrictions on the law of association.121 These “threat[s] to public peace” and expressions of “unfounded
mistrust of the maturity and independence of our people” were
denounced, and the opposition put forward its own candidate of liberal
reform, the jurist Wilhelm Kulemann of Braunschweig, whose platform
committed him to a broad program of workers’ social reform, “universal,
equal, and secret suffrage,” “equal rights,” and state support for small
urban and rural producers.122 Kulemann soon withdrew himself from consideration, after many reform liberals expressed concerns that he was
unknown to most voters in the region. After approaching the sociologist
Max Weber, who declined the offer to run for the seat, reform liberals
turned to Dr. Neff, the mayor of St. Johann, who was promptly elected as
the new reform candidate in late January 1898. Two weeks later, when the
paternalist wing chose Heinrich Boltz to run, the National Liberal Party
had two candidates.123 Throughout April, intense negotiations took place
between party leaders around Boltz, Rhine Province party chairman Dr.
Johannes, and Neff. In conciliatory tones, Neff stressed the need for the
party to take a “liberal position,” the acid test of which was the secret and
direct franchise: “A liberal man of the present,” he argued, “must also be
socially minded, and the same rights must be good for all, including the
right to vote for all workers.”124 But, fearful of a debilitating split within
the party and the growing strength of the Center, Neff was convinced to
withdraw in favor of Boltz in late April.125
Though this solution temporarily resolved the crisis, it also prompted
the reformers and their left-liberal allies in St. Johann and Saarbrücken to

Challenges to Paternalism

109

seek a new candidate and, at least publicly, forced minor concessions from
the industrialists. The reform opposition, now led by Dr. Meyer of the
Artisans’ Association, approached former commerce minister Hans von
Berlepsch, who declined the offer to stand as the liberal candidate but
encouraged opposition leaders to put forward their own candidate
nonetheless. They chose Meyer, who announced a reform-liberal political
program, which included the elements of Neff’s earlier platform and
stressed the associational rights of workers.126 Meanwhile, as part of
Neff’s withdrawal, Boltz offered public guarantees of the “liberal” commitments of the National Liberal Party. Under the coordinating in›uence
of Dr. Johannes, Neff and Boltz attended a 6 June campaign meeting, during which Boltz emphasized the similarities between his positions and
Neff’s program and reaf‹rmed his commitment to patriotism, the franchise, the right of association, and “liberal” extension of labor and social
welfare legislation “under consideration of the practical interests of economic life and the maintenance of the ability to compete economically
with other countries”—that is, without impinging on the interests of local
heavy industry.127
The election in June brought unity between the reform and paternalist factions but also demonstrated the growing power of the Center Party
in the central electoral district. Boltz easily outpaced Meyer in the ‹rst
round, with 11,094 to 2,198 votes; Meyer then urged his supporters to vote
for Boltz in the second round.128 The most effective source of party unity,
however, was the dramatic increase in the number of Center votes. The
more concentrated efforts to mobilize workers by means of the Catholic
miners’ and factory workers’ associations and the local Volksverein during the electoral campaign itself allowed Center candidate Euler to emerge
with 10,806 votes in the ‹rst round of voting—twice the number of votes
the party received in the previous Reichstag election. This success was the
‹rst demonstration of the party’s ability to actually capture the seat. The
Center campaign focused explicitly on social reform and the right of workers to organize, while also stressing the importance of defending the artisan or small producer. The campaign was led by the priest Becker, Dr.
Strauss, and Matthias Oesterling, leading ‹gures in the Volksverein and
the Saar League of Catholic Miners’ and Factory Workers’ Associations.
The small group of local Social Democratic Party supporters, who ran
Leopold Emmel in the ‹rst round of the election, urged support for the
Center candidate in the second round.129
Nevertheless, the victory of the Boltz and Saar industrialists in both

110

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

the internal National Liberal Party struggle and the elections of 1898 could
not obscure the ways in which a regionwide con›ict over the shape of labor
relations in Saar heavy industry brought new challenges to the “Stumm
system.” These challenges began with the state Sozialpolitik of the New
Course and the self-mobilization of Saar miners and other workers from
1889 to 1893, which dramatically called into question the structuring parameters of local Öffentlichkeit. After the miners’ defeat, the Catholic and
Protestant-liberal reform movements continued to contest paternalist control over the main discourses of local Öffentlichkeit—a challenge that produced a crisis within the ruling paternalist bloc from 1895 to 1898, which
divided nearly all of the institutions of the local Protestant Bürgertum: the
Saarbrücker Casino, the local gymnasium and Oberrealschule, the district
synod, the leading newspaper (Saarbrücker Zeitung), and the National
Liberal Party organization. The movements also challenged the hegemonic ideological discourse of employer paternalism itself.

chapter 4

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over
Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

The “War between the Patriots” exposed and deepened the ‹ssures within
the ruling social coalition and the dominant party-political cartel, but the
dramatic expansion of working-class associations and labor organizations
after the turn of the century brought the ‹rst systematic challenges to
paternalist authority in the Saar. During the decade before 1914, Saar
industrial workers began to form their own leisure clubs, civic associations, and occupational organizations in exponentially increasing numbers, in ways that brought working-class men and women as independent
actors directly into the routines and domains of the local public sphere.
These increases took place in the sociologically more heterogeneous cities
of Saarbrücken and St. Johann, but they were much more dramatic in the
industrial towns of Malstatt-Burbach, Neunkirchen, Sulzbach, and Dudweiler and in smaller mining communities like Illingen, where the number
of associations rose from three to over ‹fty from 1890 to 1914.1 This rapid
proliferation of independent workers’ organizations energized local social
life with new interests and constituencies, and working-class civic associations even disrupted the comfortable certainties of notable-driven municipal politics throughout the region—developments that alarmed local
of‹cials like Saarbrücken Landrat Bötticher, who noted the dif‹culties of
keeping track of working-class and especially socialist meetings and organizations owing to sheer numbers. The “insuf‹ciency of police personnel,”
he pointed out in 1904, made “surveillance of the almost daily meetings
and investigation into the actual kind” of associations holding such meetings nearly impossible.2
111

112

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

The transformation of the public sphere after 1900 was linked to the
emergence of labor movements in the Saar, which Karl Rohe has
described as a “delayed region,” where the preeminence of Christian
unionism over socialism and the relative “lateness” of independent labor
mobilization were unique in relation to developments in other industrial
districts and regions, including Berlin, Hamburg, Saxony, and even the
“late”-developing Ruhr.3 From 1899 to 1903, Social Democrats began to
build a ›edgling trade union movement and party political organization
among industrial workers in the region. This activity and concern about
the impending formation of interconfessional, antisocialist trade unions
prompted Catholic clergymen and laymen to create a network of antisocialist and conservative Catholic workers’ associations, with their own
trade sections (Fachabteilungen) for speci‹c categories of workers, beginning in 1902. But the latter were not able to halt the advance of the biconfessional (though mostly Catholic) Christian trade unions, which were
established in 1904 and became the leading representatives of Saar industrial workers, especially miners. The relative success of the Christian trade
unions over the Social Democratic unions, according to Klaus-Michael
Mallmann, was a result of the distinctive confessional geography of the
Saar, where the confessionalization of labor con›ict, pitting Catholic proletarians against Protestant employers and managers, increased the appeal
of a religiously inspired Christian unionism among Catholic migrants.4
This salutary perspective acknowledges the importance of religion in
the formation of workers’ political subjectivities, but it tends to obscure
the varying adherence to Christian unionism among Saar wage earners
and the structuring parameters and complex workings of the public
sphere, as well as the speci‹c political modalities of its transformation
after 1900.5 To understand the relative success of the Christian trade
unions and the dynamics and consequences of labor mobilization in the
prewar Saar, it is important to look beyond milieu-based considerations of
confessional geography and toward the speci‹c constellation of discursive
relations and institutions, including the state, which determined access to
the public sphere. The public sphere in the Saar was not a uniform, even,
or plural social-discursive space but, rather, an ideological ‹eld structured
in relations of social inequality and discursive hierarchy.6 It allowed certain subordinate or oppositional discourses, such as social Catholicism
and Christian unionism, and disallowed others (namely, social democracy). It contributed to the distinctive urban-industrial and confessional
geography of the regional labor movements—that is, the (albeit limited)

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

113

success of Social Democratic organizations among artisans and skilled
workers in medium-sized or small businesses located in the larger, predominantly Protestant cities and towns versus the success of Catholic
trade unions in smaller mining communities and villages. Nevertheless,
within these con‹nes, the Saar labor movements began to challenge longstanding paternalist practices and institutions in the region. This chapter
explores the ways in which workers, Catholic labor leaders, Christian
unionists, and Social Democrats struggled over the very de‹nitions and
conditions of Öffentlichkeit and gradually undermined the structures of
paternalist public authority in the Saar after 1900.

Workers, Associational Life, and Municipal Politics
The expansion of working-class associational life challenged the established routines of paternalist Öffentlichkeit in what was once a safe bastion
of employer in›uence: municipal government. Similar to developments
elsewhere in Germany, the scope of local administration and public services throughout the Saar region expanded exponentially during the years
after 1890. The construction of a whole host of new utility projects (especially gas, electricity, and water services) and transportation facilities
(including streets and rail lines and connections) and the expansion of
existing facilities dramatically transformed the physical spaces and infrastructure of Saar municipalities and communes—a transformation most
visible with the uni‹cation of Saarbrücken, St. Johann, and Malstatt-Burbach into the Grossstadt of Saarbrücken in 1909. These changes resulted in
larger municipal councils or at least discussions about the need to increase
the number of councillors; the rapid proliferation of new municipal committees and agencies; and, above all, the dramatic increase in the numbers
of civil servants and municipal bureaucrats, who were necessary for the
administration of city services. They were ‹nanced in large part by increasing tax revenues levied not just on the incomes of local industrialists and
notables but also on the rising incomes of small business owners, artisans,
and industrial workers, especially miners in the local mining communities.
In this context, third-class and even some second-class voters began to
form new civic associations (Bürgervereine) that challenged the monopoly
of industrialist notables over the town councils after 1900.
Modeled on existing bourgeois organizations in the sociologically
more heterogeneous cities of Saarbrücken and St. Johann from the 1860s

114

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

to the 1880s, these organizations were run by varying coalitions of shop
owners, artisans, and industrial workers but reported largely workingclass memberships. Adopting such names as Local Interest Association,
Association for the Discussion of Municipal Matters, Association for the
Protection of Local Interests, or simply Citizens’ Association, they proliferated rapidly after 1905 throughout towns and communities as diverse as
Malstatt-Burbach, Dillingen, Altenwald-Hühnerfeld, Sulzbach, IllingenGennweiler, Merschweiler, Altenkessel-Neudorf, Herrensohr, Fischbach,
Hüttigweiler, Uchtelfangen, Wemmetsweiler, Wiebelskirchen, and
Russhütte. In the mining communities, miners dominated or even led the
new associations, which claimed much larger memberships and evinced
even higher levels of political mobilization than the associations in the
medium-sized industrial towns. The effort to form the Bürgerverein of
Illingen, for example, was chaired by the carter Peter Klein and the activist
miner Johann Schäfer.7 The most impressive organizational success of this
kind was achieved by the Association for the Protection of Local Interests
in Altenwald-Hühnerfeld, predominantly a mining area that was also the
site of the Röchling coking plant. By the fall of 1908, its chairman, housepainter Heinrich Michael Losch, presided over an organization of 668
members, of whom 425 were active miners, 55 were pensioned miners, and
the remaining 188 were nearly all wage earners, white-collar workers, and
artisans.8
Together, the new Bürgervereine constituted a novel and broadly
based social movement throughout the region—an emergent proletarian
public, with its own organizations and means of public communication,
which demanded more “openness” (Öffentlichkeit) and accountability in
municipal affairs. The numerous associations were supported by activists
like Johann Schäfer, who encouraged the formation of Bürgervereine and
delivered the “most bombastic speeches” at different meetings throughout
the district of Ottweiler; indeed, local of‹cials believed his aim was to
“unify all Bürgervereine in one larger movement.”9 They were also brought
into a shared ‹eld of discourse by the efforts of Hermann Josef Meurer,
who moved to the Saar from Essen-Altendorf and published a regional
newspaper called Citizen’s Friend (Bürgerfreund), which became a central
medium of this emergent public.10 Local activists self-consciously conceived of the civic associations as public organizations in which Saar “citizens” could register complaints and ‹le petitions in matters related to the
expropriation of property for public building projects, the ‹nancial costs
of street and building construction, canalization, the leasing and unequal

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

115

use of public facilities (e.g., gas and waterworks, electricity, sanitation,
and the rail system), the enforcement of housing codes, the size and purpose of municipal bureaucracies, and taxes.11 But their principal goal was
to mobilize local residents in the cause of municipal self-governance, especially during election time. According to the editors of Citizen’s Friend,
“The heretofore peaceful, much too peaceful citizen [Bürger] would like
more energetically to defend himself, to engage in his own behalf. The
municipal council elections provide the opportunity to do this. . . . These
election days can and should be accountability days [Zahltage], during
which deceitful municipal councillors who are unfaithful and lose the trust
of their voters are kicked out.”12 In the process, they challenged the
de‹nitions of Öffentlichkeit as a criterion of openness and its realization in
the work of Saar municipal councils.13
Already in 1901, the municipal council in Neunkirchen entertained its
‹rst motion regarding “the principle of Öffentlichkeit,” in response to petitions from local citizens and the “active desire of a large portion of the
local residents for openness [Öffentlichkeit]”; as a consequence, it gave
three different newspapers access to its meetings.14 In October 1909, the
failure of the local council to publicize its agenda moved editors of the
Völklinger Zeitung to insist on the broader relevance of council affairs and
to question the failure of the councillors to publicize their activities in the
steel town of Völklingen.
One asks involuntarily: Why? Why this petty-minded secrecy? After
all, this exclusion of the public [Öffentlichkeit] may only take place for
the most serious of reasons. We believe that the still legally valid
though obsolete Rhine Municipal Ordinance, which is completely
unsuited to our industrial city, should not serve as a convenient
means by which to keep the citizens in ignorance and doubt about
their most important public issues.15
In 1911, Chairman Bößmann of the Dudweiler association called for a
municipal ordinance that was “appropriate to the times” in a way that “set
in law” the “duties of provincial of‹cials” and the “openness”
(Öffentlichkeit) of the municipal council meetings.16 In these ways, the new
civic associations, assisted by some local newspapers and even some sympathetic councillors, attempted to expand prevailing de‹nitions of
Öffentlichkeit by stressing the importance of open discussion of town
affairs, regular press reporting of the minutes of council meetings, “public

116

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

control over . . . council meetings,” or the role of civic associations as a
“connective channel” between the council and the wider citizenry.17
Members of the new Bürgervereine articulated their formal aims in
general appeals to citizenship and public accountability, but they also
drew on a latent class-oriented perspective that stressed the unequal economic burdens imposed by municipal growth and railed against the overriding in›uence of heavy industry, in ways that challenged the paternalist
structures of local Öffentlichkeit as a collective subject. They routinely
invoked the “public,” the “public interest,” the “public well-being,” and
the wider “citizenry” (Bürgerschaft) in order to stake their own claims and
legitimize their concerns, and they claimed to speak on behalf of “all occupations and classes of citizens,” especially the “tenacious farmer,” the
“industrious artisan,” the “active small businessman,” and the “struggling
industrial worker.”18 But civic activists like Meurer, who were often connected to the Christian and Social Democratic unions, also emphasized
the importance of the labor movements for galvanizing the sentiments of
workers and “other occupational groups” in favor of “political freedom.”
They de‹ned the principal lines of municipal con›ict in class terms by
claiming to represent the taxpaying citizenry or “citizen’s party” (Bürgerpartei) in opposition to the local ruling coalitions of mining of‹cials, factory owners, and managers—the Hüttenpartei or Grubenpartei—which
dominated local councils. In Illingen, association members regularly complained of the perceived inequalities in water usage: local heavy industry,
Bürgerverein chairman Peter Klein argued, received more than their share
and a better quality of water than local residents.19 Chairman Peter
Beckinger of the Dillingen Bürgerverein criticized plans of the Dillingen
steelworks to obliterate a much-used thoroughfare as part of its plans to
expand its factory grounds, and he rejected the notion that local citizens
were “entirely dependent on the factory.”20 In Dudweiler, the miner Peter
Henrikus, a member of the Local Interests Association, argued forcefully
that Dudweiler councillors should begin to re›ect the sociology of the
population at large; since fully three-quarters of Dudweiler’s residents
were workers, he claimed in 1911, then ‹fteen of the council seats should be
occupied by workers and the remaining nine by of‹cials and businessmen
(Beamte and Geschäftsleute).21 Henrikus, like many other civic association
activists, thereby directly challenged the long-standing paternalist calculus
governing the distribution of municipal council seats throughout the
region.
Nevertheless, the desire to avoid overtly religious and political themes

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

117

in association statutes and during meetings and the tendency to embrace
the central discursive strategies of bourgeois Öffentlichkeit muted the
activism of the Bürgervereine and curbed their potential militancy. As they
mobilized citizens (Bürger) against of‹cials (Beamten) of local mining
inspections or factories in an effort to claim the universal interest of the
public against the particular interest of capital, the associations’ claims to
universality could come undone in the citizen-worker distinction. This
happened in the Dudweiler Ortsinteressenverein [Local Interests Association] in 1911, when association chairman Bößmann, the director of the
local mining dormitory, argued in favor of a more equitable distribution
of council seats (eight for mining of‹cials, seven for local small businessmen, and nine for workers) but also warned workers “not to allow themselves to be incited” and “to vote for people who will represent the interests of the citizens.” The existing forms of representation should be
maintained, Bößmann argued: “The worker is not in a position to represent the interests of the citizens—labor makes him tired and weary; they
[sic] should elect people around them (even mining of‹cials) who have the
interests of the workers in view and in whom they can place their trust.”22
From Bößmann’s perspective, industrial workers did not qualify as universal citizens capable of representing the interests of the “public.”
More serious was the threat from employers and local state of‹cials,
who grew concerned about the political implications of this bourgeoning
civic activism, the growing “politicization” of municipal council elections,
and the fracturing of the putatively unitary “public.” Already in 1903, mining of‹cials were sacking workers who dared to stand for elections to local
councils. In Püttlingen, for example, the miner Edlinger was dismissed for
his involvement with an electoral committee composed of miners, who
planned to support Edlinger as a candidate and thereby challenge the
numerical preponderance of mining of‹cials in the local Gemeinderat
[town council].23 Employers in private heavy industry were even more
thorough. Of‹cials of the Dillingen steelworks, who forced the resignation
of a popular mayor of Dillingen in the fall of 1903, sent company employees to the meetings of the newly formed Ortsinteressen-Verein in January
1908 in order to compile lists of any workers in their employ who might be
attending; made sure that copies of all association petitions with member
signatures were distributed to all of the councillors on the Dillingen council, who of course included of‹cials of the steelworks; and pressured their
employees to stay away from the organization. By February 1908, the sudden exodus of most of its members had practically destroyed the civic

118

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

association in Dillingen.24 At the same time, local state of‹cials proceeded
in more legalistic ways. In January 1907, Landrat Laur of Ottweiler
noti‹ed all mayors in his district of the “unwanted” involvement of citizens’ associations in local elections and public assemblies. Insisting they
provided a forum only for the “machinations” of self-interested individuals and therefore not the general concerns of the “public,” he urged the
mayors to maintain close surveillance over civic association meetings; to
proceed “severely” (unnachsichtlich) with criminal charges against any
person who slanders a public of‹cial; and to resist conferring corporation
status on any association, in order to head off attempts to gain the legal
right of petition.25 These activities were made easier by a January 1908
decision of the Saarbrücken Criminal Court, in a case involving efforts to
suppress the activities of women in the Dillingen citizens’ association,
which determined that the civic associations were to be treated as political
organizations and subjected to regulations regarding the of‹cial registration of meetings and police surveillance.26 Finally, in the rare instances
when association members spoke in ways that violated the norms of polite
speech, as Johann Schäfer did in Illingen in March 1907, of‹cials promptly
‹led criminal charges against them.27
These actions of industrialists and state of‹cials and the self-limitations of some civic organizers put the brakes on the broader movement of
civic associations by 1909–10. The last issues of Citizen’s Friend were
apparently published in the fall of 1909 in Saarbrücken and in April 1910 in
Neunkirchen; and by January 1910, the police in Saarbrücken were reporting that the paper could no longer attract subscribers, though the civic
associations themselves were not entirely dissolved.28 Nevertheless, the
Bürgervereine did succeed in bringing new working-class constituencies
into the arena of municipal politics in ways that challenged the paternalist
hegemony of industrialist notables in the local public sphere. Their
protests threatened to open up municipal council meetings and paternalist
priorities to broader scrutiny and raised issues of municipal accountability
that could no longer be quietly ignored or easily silenced, especially as
their activism merged with the Saar labor movements after 1906.

Social Democrats, the State, and the Public Sphere
The general proliferation of working-class associations was both the precondition and the consequence of trade union mobilization, including the

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

119

efforts of Social Democrats, in the Saar. From their bases in Saarbrücken
and St. Johann, where they had established an electoral association in 1898
and a trade union cartel in 1899, Social Democrats built the embryonic
institutions of a socialist public in the region after 1900. This activity began
with discussions about organizing Saar miners (which took place as early
as 1899 within the national leadership of the Free Trade Unions) and with
increasing numbers of meetings held by local socialists in 1901 and 1902.
But concerted efforts to break into the “Kingdom of Stumm,” led by
Nikolaus Osterroth, a clay miner from the Palatinate, were launched in
1903, and the main recruitment drive began on 1 May 1904.29 Local union
organizers also set up a workers’ secretariat for dispensing legal aid to
workers in St. Johann; and in December 1904 and January 1905, they
began to publish the ‹rst issues of the Social Democratic newspaper
Saarwacht. By these means, Saar Social Democrats generated their ‹rst
effective public presence throughout the region: though their largest political assemblies still took place in Saarbrücken and “red St. Johann,” they
were also able to hold their ‹rst public meetings in the industrial towns of
Völklingen, Malstatt-Burbach, and Neunkirchen after 1905. In February
1907, they even established an association for the district of Ottweiler in
Neunkirchen, a location the bricklayer and civic association trustee
Johann Lohr called the “blackest corner of Saarabia.”30 By the summer of
1907, Otto Hué, national chairman of the socialist miners’ union, the Alter
Verband, was speaking to audiences of ‹ve hundred people in
Neunkirchen; and by 1912, the Alter Verband was holding mass meetings
in the small industrial village of Wiebelskirchen.31
Nevertheless, the Social Democratic movement in the prewar Saar
never quite broke out of the urban-industrial geography of paternalism
and the constraints of the local public sphere. At the end of the “Stumm
era,” Social Democratic supporters were employed almost exclusively outside the reach of heavy industry—mostly in the small workshops, construction sites, and state-owned rail yards in Saarbrücken and St.
Johann—and in areas of Protestant or confessionally mixed settlement.
After 1900, moreover, the SPD’s electoral association for the district of
Saarbrücken never moved much beyond its sociology and location of 1898,
when it comprised mostly joiners and masons from Saarbrücken and St.
Johann, even though Social Democrats did manage to attract increasing
numbers of supporters in Neunkirchen and in heavily Protestant Wiebelskirchen, a community of miners after 1907.32 In addition, the Free Trade
Unions, which were only able to establish local branches among tailors,

120

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

joiners and shoemakers, construction workers, painters, printers, and bakers during the 1890s in Saarbrücken and St. Johann, failed to move into
most of the industrial towns and mining villages of the region after 1900.33
In 1902, they reported only ten local branches with 513 members, none of
whom were miners or steelworkers; and by 1908, after ‹ve more years of
organizing, they could report only twenty-eight local branches, still mostly
based in the construction, artisanal, and metalworking trades, with 3,835
members. By the end of 1910, the Alter Verband claimed only 862 members
from among the 50,802 miners employed in the state-run Saar mines.34
Not surprisingly, Social Democratic Party organizations, which managed
to attract only 777 members by 1913, faired poorly in regional Reichstag
elections. When it won a third of the popular vote nationally and sent
more delegates to the Reichstag than any other party in 1912, the SPD was
able to win only 7.8 percent of the vote in the electoral district of Saarbrücken, 4 percent in Ottweiler, and 3.7 percent in Saarlouis.35
These patterns of Social Democratic mobilization and the limited
appeal of socialism among workers in the prewar Saar were shaped by the
ideological forces and institutional barriers that determined access to the
local public sphere. The latter included an already existing and growing
Catholic public actively constructed in opposition to the threat of socialism, with a long-standing network of religious leadership and associations,
new occupational associations (especially the Catholic workers’ associations and Christian trade unions discussed later in this chapter), and Center Party organizations.36 The institutional authority of local priests and
teachers, from the pulpit and in the schools, reinforced this opposition.
Catholic priests, like many Protestant pastors in the Saar, made no secret
of the fact that they routinely took an opportunity during masses to warn
their parishioners away from social democracy—a practice Saar miners
revealed in a survey (which kept names con‹dential) conducted by the
social commentator Adolf Levenstein in 1912.37
More serious was the ‹erce resistance of the leading Saar industrialists, who closely monitored socialist activity throughout the region and
coordinated a series of antisocialist measures with the assistance of state
of‹cials. In 1903, employers and managers from all of the leading local
‹rms posted notices on their factory gates in response to the Social Democratic recruitment drive and threatened immediate dismissal of workers
who participated in socialist activities.38 In January 1905, of‹cials of the
Neunkirchen, Röchling, Burbach, Halberg, and Dillingen steelworks
issued similar warnings with the appearance of Saarwacht.39 Moreover, in

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

121

December 1903, in order to create a comprehensive system of surveillance
and blacklisting, Chairman Ewald Hilger of the Mining Of‹ce met with
the directors of nearly all of the principal mining and steel concerns
located in Völklingen and Hostenbach, Malstatt-Burbach, Brebach,
Neunkirchen, St. Ingbert, and neighboring Lorraine and the Palatinate.
Run by the Mining Of‹ce in Saarbrücken, the system entailed the organized exchange of information about trade union meetings and activities,
with the circulation of reports to all participating employers as well as to
the Landräte in Saarbrücken and Ottweiler, the Kreisdirektor [county
director] in Forbach (Lorraine), and the director of the railroad administration in St. Johann. In accordance with this arrangement, company
of‹cials and informants attended local union and socialist meetings,
reported on the content of each discussion, and identi‹ed the workers
present so that their names could be sent to their employers.40 By the
spring of 1904, Saar industrialists had established their own newsletter, the
Gewerkschaftliche Nachrichten (Trade Union News), which reported regularly on all socialist and trade union activities and, by the fall of 1904, circulated blacklists compiled by local ‹rms under a common policy of sacking all workers who attended SPD or trade union meetings, read socialist
literature, or in any way expressed socialist sympathies.41 This kind of surveillance and intimidation and their consequences for workers—which
ranged from the sack or transfer to less remunerative work to physical
attacks and, in one case, “hunt[ing]” the Social Democrat Osterroth out of
town with a ‹re hose—amounted to a wide-ranging effort to police the
expanding spaces of the local public sphere, from the factory workplaces
and mines to the local taverns and streets, and directly involved state
of‹cials in the long-standing tradition of local collusion.42
Nevertheless, Saar Social Democrats introduced a new style of political mobilization, which directly and indirectly—insofar as it forced others
to contend with Social Democratic methods—expanded the sites and the
constituencies of Öffentlichkeit in the region. Local organizers launched a
grassroots effort to distribute Social Democratic lea›ets, brochures, and
newspapers outside the factories and mines, in the workers’ dormitories,
on trains, and from house to house—often delivering them at night to
avoid the authorities.43 These efforts initially began to bear fruit: Social
Democrats began to attract supporters in the industrial districts and even
in Catholic communities long closed to their organizations. Despite the
dif‹culties of identifying socialist sympathies in a highly repressive environment like the Saar, it is clear that increasing numbers of Saar steel-

122

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

workers, miners, and glassworkers, a number of whom were Catholic,
began to read socialist literature and attend meetings of the Free Trade
Unions after 1903. These included employees of the Röchling steelworks in
Völklingen, the Burbach steelworks and the Dingler & Karcher machine
factory in Malstatt-Burbach, the Dillingen steelworks, and the Reppert
glassworks in Friedrichsthal.44 Saar miners demonstrated even greater
interest. The Social Democrat Karl Krämer found a growing number of
receptive miners in 1903–4 and was preparing to set up a branch of the
Alter Verband in Sulzbach; when local of‹cials searched his residence in
the spring of 1904, they found a list of eighty Saar miners who were receiving the Alter Verband’s newspaper. By 1905, some 280 miners had subscribed to the paper, and by September 1912, according to the Landrat of
Ottweiler, the number of Saar miners who belonged to the socialist Alter
Verband exceeded one thousand.45 Through efforts at grassroots mobilization beyond the meeting hall, therefore, workers in smaller communities, such as Püttlingen and Wiebelskirchen, and in the larger towns of
Sulzbach and Neunkirchen (once the central redoubt of Stumm’s paternalism) had opportunities to become involved in union and political matters.
With similar consequences, Social Democratic mobilization addressed
women and entire families in direct ways. Despite their privileging of class
over gender and periodic references to the male breadwinner, Social Democrats formally embraced sexual equality in their party program and
solicited women’s active participation in trade union and political activities
more than all other organized labor and political movements in imperial
Germany. In the Saar, women (and children) participated in lea›eting
activities in the house-to-house campaigns, but female party members were
also involved in these efforts in the areas around the main factories. In 1908,
for example, local party chairman Emil Leimpeters was distributing handbills in Burbach with two female party “comrades” (Genossinnen), Frau
Ruff and Frau Wolz, both of whom were physically threatened by of‹cials
of the Burbach steelworks.46 Moreover, unlike leaders of other political
parties and labor organizations, Social Democratic trade union and party
activists encouraged women to attend their meetings, both as wives of
workers and as workers themselves. As early as March 1903, twenty-one
out of forty-nine participants in a metalworkers’ meeting in St. Johann
were women; in April 1903, women were attending meetings of glassworkers in St. Johann; and in August 1903, women were invited to attend the
‹rst major miners’ meeting held by the SPD in St. Ingbert. This practice

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

123

continued after 1908, when the Prussian law of association was changed to
allow for the participation of women in political meetings and organizations. By 1910, at least one local woman, Frau P›üger, was a leader of the
party organization in Neunkirchen, and women were routinely attending
meetings in Neunkirchen and Wiebelskirchen.47
These forms of mobilization were part of a more militant style of
activism, often linked to actions on the shop ›oor, during the period from
1903 to 1906. The ‹rst workers to organize labor actions and conduct
strikes were the Social Democratic construction workers, brewery workers, and printers in Saarbrücken and St. Johann. By the spring of 1904,
Social Democratic printers had successfully organized workers employed
by all of the major publishers in Saarbrücken and St. Johann, had secured
collective wage agreements, and were attempting to win recruits from
among the employees of August Spiess Press, an industry-friendly publisher in Malstatt-Burbach. In early 1904, the local trade union cartel, led
by the typesetter Christmann, carried out a successful boycott of the
Mügel Brewery, which secured higher wages and the rehiring of a dismissed activist. It shortly thereafter launched a similarly successful action
against the Aktien Brewery of St. Johann-Saarbrücken. At the same time,
354 bricklayers launched a three-week strike against local construction
companies in May 1904.48 These actions were followed by socialist
attempts to move closer to the centers of Saar paternalism, when employees of the Reppert glassworks in Friedrichsthal established a small local
branch of the Social Democratic Union of Glassworkers and Related
Trades (Verband der Glasarbeiter und Arbeiterinnen und verwandter
Gewerke Deutschlands) in 1901. In March 1906, they launched a successful
strike against the company in response to declining wages and inadequate
raw materials.49
Another Social Democratic strategic innovation lay in taking advantage of the state-mandated industrial courts and sickness insurance funds,
which included both workers and employers on their governing boards, in
order to expand the boundaries of the local public sphere.50 Like the pattern of socialist mobilization more generally, political contestation over
the composition of the industrial courts and the boards of the sickness
funds followed distinctive urban-industrial patterns and bene‹ted mostly
workers from the artisanal trades in the larger towns, small businesses,
and the smaller machine and metalworking factories in the Saar. As early
as 1902, Social Democrats managed to elect a majority of worker representatives to the industrial court in Saarbrücken.51 By 1910, they had

124

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

secured eight out of twelve mandates in the second chamber, responsible
for disputes within small industry; but in the ‹rst chamber, with jurisdiction over workers in heavy industry, they did not even put up a list.52 In the
elections to the boards of the sickness funds, in which Social Democrats
were able to establish a foothold, a similar pattern is evident. They gained
control over the governing boards in Saarbrücken and St. Johann by 1903;
indeed, most of the employer representatives in these institutions were
socialists (three or four of six in Saarbrücken and four of six in St.
Johann), and in St. Johann, most of the delegates to the general assembly
were socialists (104 out of 116). By contrast, in Malstatt-Burbach in 1903,
there were no socialist members on the board of the Ortskrankenkasse
[local sickness insurance fund], and there was no organized trade union to
even put up a list.53 When the socialist unions ‹nally did manage to contest
the elections in Malstatt-Burbach in December 1906, they ran up against a
uni‹ed employer opposition, were expelled by the chairman after their
election to the board, and then were defeated by a coalition of employers,
confessional workers’ associations, and Christian trade unions in a subsequent election.54 Nevertheless, by 1914, the socialist unions had captured a
majority of the workers’ seats on the governing boards of the sickness
funds in Saarbrücken and St. Johann and the umbrella sickness fund created by the uni‹cation of Saarbrücken, St. Johann, and Malstatt-Burbach
into one Grossstadt in 1909; they had also won a majority of workers’ seats
in Neunkirchen; and they were contesting elections in Völklingen.55
This “legalistic” strategy of turning state institutions to their own
ends was organized through a discourse of class interest and citizenship
rights, which avoided explicit invocations of Öffentlichkeit as the basis on
which to make political claims. Saar Social Democrats generally spoke in
the name of workers and their class interests, rather than overtly in the
name of the “public” interest, in a language of class emancipation that
emphasized connections between economic privation and exploitation and
the infantilizing effects of company paternalism.56 In response, however,
to formidable efforts to suppress their movement, Saar Social Democrats
adopted a political strategy focused on the struggle to defend the worker’s
legally guaranteed right to organize—that is, a strategy of gradualist proceduralism and constitutional legality. In their appeals to workers, they
equated work relations and the paternalist “system of cultivation” with
“slavery” and the “deprivation of rights.” The local Social Democrat Karl
Krämer, in an orientalist formulation common to radical and liberal critiques of the day, likened the “systematic repression of workers’ freedoms”

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

125

in the Saar to conditions obtaining in an “Asiatic” state. In “Saarabia,” he
maintained, workers were treated as “underage children” or “subjects”
and denied their legal right to association and equality before the law.
“All citizens are equal before the law” is the meaning of the fundamental principle of every constitutional state. Through the Imperial
Industrial Code (section 152), we miners are also granted the right of
free assembly, which allows us to meet in private organizations to discuss grievances from work and to obtain better wages, etc. No one
has the right to deny us these organizations of the basis of the industrial code. Nevertheless, there exists in Saar mining no trade union
organization, because each comrade knows or assumes, on the basis
of experience, that he will suffer “economic disadvantages” at work if
he makes use of his legal right to association in a way deemed unacceptable by “those above.”
In this way, local Social Democrats linked economic deprivation and the
lack of a “humane existence” to the systematic subversion of workers’
“constitutionally guaranteed citizenship rights” by employers and called
on industrial workers to “wake up,” to “break the chains of slavery,” and
to make use of their right to organize.57
This strategy had important consequences for Öffentlichkeit in the
region, because local state of‹cials, as “neutral” civil servants, were vulnerable to charges of violating workers’ constitutional rights—a vulnerability dramatically revealed in a very public libel trial involving the prosecution of Saar miner and Social Democrat Karl Krämer and initiated by
Chairman Ewald Hilger of the Mining Of‹ce in 1904.58 Sacked for his
attendance at a socialist meeting in St. Ingbert in August 1903, Krämer
was prosecuted for distributing handbills (cited in the preceding paragraph) that criticized the “oppressive” paternalist labor regime in Saar
mining, for its low wages and its restrictions on the worker’s “legal right to
association.”59 The eight-day trial in Saarbrücken ended in Krämer’s conviction (later dismissed by an appeals court), but not before his lawyer,
Social Democrat Wolfgang Heine, was able to bring sixty-nine witnesses
to the stand and thereby generate a wider public discussion of labor relations in Saar mining. More than any other local event, the trial brought
attention to the low wages and poor living conditions of Saar miners, the
frequent verbal harassment and corporal punishment meted out by
Steiger, abuses committed by Knappschaft doctors, and the extensive elec-

126

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

toral in›uence brought to bear on Catholic and Social Democratic voters
by the Mining Of‹ce. In the end, it exposed the antisocialist and anti-Center practices of the Mining Of‹ce to both regional and national publics.
Both Hilger’s unabashed defense of the policy of sacking all workers
linked in any way to socialist activities and the widespread evidence of discrimination and intimidation of Catholic miners during elections angered
not only Social Democratic, liberal, and Center politicians and supporters
but state ministers and of‹cials as well. Concern over negative publicity
prompted Hilger’s resignation as chairman of the Mining Of‹ce in February 1905.
In response to criticism and out of fear that deploying long-standing
paternalist measures of coercion could ultimately back‹re and generate
support for the Alter Verband, Hilger’s replacement, Wilhelm Cleff,
implemented a new antisocialist strategy that rede‹ned the boundary
between private and public in relation to the political activities of Saar
miners. The Mining Of‹ce would no longer dismiss miners for their “passive” involvement in socialist activities—that is, for attending meetings,
reading socialist newspapers, or voting for the SPD. Instead, it would sack
only the “leading personalities” of the movement and miners who engaged
in “public agitation for social democracy.” This meant that Social Democratic miners were sacked for chairing or renting halls for Alter Verband
or SPD meetings, speaking during the latter, or distributing socialist
lea›ets. Moreover, in a policy change of enormous consequences, of‹cials
of the Mining Of‹ce decided they would no longer sack or punish miners
for any kind of involvement in the Christian Miners’ Union of Germany
(Gewerkverein christlicher Bergarbeiter Deutschlands).60 The aim was to
contain the Social Democratic movement by preventing any employed
miners from becoming leaders of the trade union or party organizations.
This new policy, mining of‹cials believed, would achieve its aim in several
ways: it would reduce the number of local functionaries and burden party
‹nances by forcing its members to support all of their leaders ‹nancially;
remove Social Democratic leaders from the pits and prevent their recruitment efforts at the workplace and their involvement in works council and
safety steward elections; and limit the appeal of local socialist organizers
to those still employed. Above all, according to Cleff, the new policy made
it possible to keep a better eye on the Social Democratic movement, since
the practice of dismissing workers for any and all SPD af‹liations would
force socialist miners underground—in which case, Cleff argued, “all too
many embers would gather beneath the ashes, and we could be surprised

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

127

by a sudden explosion, the scale of which we would be unable to measure
in advance.”61 In July 1910, when mining management discussed the possibility of renewing contacts with local industrialists for the purpose of combating social democracy with all available means, Cleff explicitly acknowledged the differences between local private industry and the state-run
mines that motivated this policy: “If the private employer is allowed to use
any means which the law and his own interest permits in this struggle,”
Cleff argued, “so the state as employer is enjoined from adopting measures
that contradict the demands that public opinion makes on the state administration in regard to its labor policy.”62 Against the backdrop of a series
of state policies and constitutional guarantees, including the passage of a
new law maintaining the secrecy of the Reichstag ballot in 1903 and the
imperial government’s decision not to seek coercive legislation to curb the
growth of social democracy after the failure of the Penitentiary Bill of
1899, Cleff and the leadership of the Mining Of‹ce acknowledged the end
of the “Stumm system” in Saar mining.

Catholic Labor, Christian Trade Unionism, and the Limitations
of Bourgeois Öffentlichkeit
Saar Social Democrats realized few direct bene‹ts from the actions of the
Mining Of‹ce, but the confessional labor movements were directly privileged by the new policy. Christian labor in the Saar region was divided
between the supporters of the Catholic workers’ associations and the
Christian trade unions. During the summer of 1902, the former set down
roots in the Saar as members of the League of Catholic Workers’ Associations, Headquarters Berlin (Verband der katholischen Arbeitervereine
Deutschlands, Sitz Berlin), as part of the Catholic clergy’s wider response
to the rise of social democracy in the wake of Rerum Novarum. But
the more immediate cause of concern was the growing consolidation of the
Christian trade unions, which created an umbrella organization in
the National League of Christian Trade Unions on 1 January 1901, and the
appeal from the Catholic workers’ associations in Cologne in 1899 encouraging Catholic workers to join the biconfessional unions. In response, in
August 1900, Cardinal Georg Kopp of Breslau, with the support of Felix
Korum, the bishop of Trier, issued the Fulda pastoral, which called on all
priests and Catholic organizers to oppose the bi-confessional organizations and to build workers’ associations, especially trade sections (Fach-

128

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

abteilungen) according to the branch of industry, under the auspices of the
Catholic Church.63 Concentrated in the dioceses of Breslau and Trier,
which included the Saar region, the Catholic workers’ associations of the
“Berlin Direction” developed into an important antisocialist and conservative movement, which also opposed other Catholic organizations, including the League of Catholic Workers’ Associations of Western Germany
(Verband katholischer Arbeitervereine Westdeutschlands), the League of
Catholic Workers’ Associations of South Germany (Verband katholischer
Arbeitervereine Süddeutschlands), and the Volksverein für das katholische Deutschland.
The formation of the regional organization for the Saar district came
after a meeting of 122 priests on 26 June 1902 in Trier and began with the
creation of a diocesan league the following November. Led by priests and
executive committees staffed by local clergy and laypersons, the Catholic
workers’ associations and their trade sections offered a wide range of assistance to workers, including representation in matters related to work and
wages; ‹nancial support during lockouts, strikes (launched by other workers), periods of unemployment, and cases involving disciplinary actions
(Massregelungen) by employers; and legally nonbinding bene‹ts, ranging
from funeral and moving allowances to support in the case of sickness.64 In
addition, they sponsored a program of general sociability and cultural
activities through their “entertainment evenings” and other social events,
annual “social courses” for the purpose of “schooling” association leaders
and “workers in contemporary social questions,” and regional workers’
secretariats that provided legal aid to Catholic workers in St. Johann and
Neunkirchen.65 On this basis, Saar priests and Catholic laypersons were
able to build a sizable regional movement: after 1907, league numbers leveled off at eighty-six associations with eighty-two Fachabteilungen and
16,500 members, mostly miners.66
Catholic leaders de‹ned the new workers’ organizations as ‹rst and
foremost antisocialist formations, but they also sought to counter the
activities of the Christian trade unions—a position that dovetailed with
employer paternalism. Whereas the Social Democrats were attacked for
their materialist irreligion and their revolutionary challenges to the existing social and political order, the Christian unions were accused, in contradictory ways, of unnecessarily exposing Catholic workers to Protestantism within the biconfessional organizations and of encouraging
secular views by their exclusion of religious considerations from the calculation of occupational interests.67 This not only removed the authority of

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

129

the Catholic Church from this important area of workers’ lives; it also prevented religion from solving the “social question,” understood here as the
“worker question.”68 Leaders of the Catholic workers’ associations therefore distanced their organizations from the Social Democratic unions and
the Christian trade unions by seeking “gradual” improvements and “social
reconciliation” by means of legislation, and they openly polemicized
against the strike. Striking, Dr. Fleischer explained in a 1904 “social
course,” “endangers the natural duty of the worker to maintain his own
and his family’s existence” and “generates the most dreadful terrorism and
endangers the personal freedom of coworkers under the threat of economic disadvantages.”69
This approach converged with employer paternalism in another way:
like the Catholic reform initiatives of the 1890s, it rested on an explicitly
gendered ideological commitment to cultivating the private lives of male
industrial workers—especially the “appropriate” gender order of the
working-class family—as a means of controlling their public activity. The
“cultivation [Ausbildung] of the worker,” as one “social course” lecture
pointedly argued, involved imbuing workers with the “virtues” associated
with work and obedience: “diligence, loyalty, modesty, thrift, family values, and occupational pride [Standesbewusstsein].”70 This meant sponsoring a range of family activities, from leisure activities to special courses
designed, according to the league newspaper Der Arbeiter, to promote an
“orderly domestic life” in working-class families, including a “suf‹cient,
healthy, and friendly apartment,” “a diligent, careful Hausfrau, who keeps
everything clean and in order, who knows how to maintain a household,
who understands how to keep domestic order and to prepare tasty meals
with limited means,” and “children who in their clothing and behavior
manifest order and a good upbringing.”71 This moralizing project of cultural improvement was aimed at rooting out the “immorality and immoderateness” of the worker and the “immoral relations in the family,” manifested in the growing “desire for pleasure” and consumer entertainments,
the expansion of club life, and the rise of social democracy more generally.72 In a 1904 speech before the Catholic workers’ association in
Neunkirchen, which detailed the league’s methods for immunizing workers against the allure of pubs, commercial entertainments, and social
democracy, Pastor Schütz of Wiebelskirchen made these connections
between moral “education” and public life explicit: “One must give the
worker the opportunity to ‹nd other kinds of enjoyments,” he maintained,
by providing lectures and appropriate reading materials to him. “If we

130

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

want to have hope for success in the future,” Schütz continued, “then it is
necessary for Catholic workers to try to further cultivate and school themselves; in that way they will be in a position to support our cause in public
life and be able to respond to the speech of our opponents.”73
As the preceding quote suggests, Catholic labor leaders embraced the
discursive strategies of bourgeois Öffentlichkiet and repeatedly called on
“the public” to validate their own claims. The possibility that Catholic
labor politics would provide a space for working-class self-assertion, however, was circumscribed by its reliance on gradualist proceduralism,
of‹cial benevolence, and limited appeals to a well-meaning “public.” In an
exemplary formulation that implicitly demoted a “worker” interest in relation to a “public” interest, Catholic workers’ association secretary
Bartholomäus Koßmann, the leading activist of the associations in the
region, explained to a 1909 miners’ meeting in Neunkirchen that the
demand for an eight-hour day in mining could not be realized simply by
workers demanding it.
The workers must also try to bring public opinion onto their side. I
don’t believe that the employer in question here would be so shameless—to use an unparliamentary expression—as to take away something from the workers in a way that seemed unjusti‹ed in the eyes of
the public [Öffentlichkeit]. On the occasion of his visit to Altenwald,
the former commerce minister Delbrück said: “If you have grievances, then you should direct them to me in Berlin, and I will help in
so far as the complaint is justi‹ed.” We want to take these words seriously and turn to Berlin if the mining of‹cials here do not give us
what we want. We would say, “Here now are our wishes; now keep
your promise.”74
This statement of strategy pointed to the avenue of of‹cial redress that
favored the Catholic workers’ associations and Christian trade unions
over Social Democratic organizations, but it also indicated the limitations
of appeals to the bourgeois public sphere that curbed the militancy of prewar Catholic labor in the Saar.
Despite the overall success of Catholic priests and lay activists in
building workers’ organizations with trade sections, they were not able to
prevent the emergence of Christian trade unions in the Saar. Beginning in
1904, a full decade after the completion of similar efforts in the Ruhr, representatives of the Christian Miners’ Union began attempts to organize

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

131

Saar miners.75 Initially, Gewerkverein organizers managed to hold meetings only in the mining districts that lay outside of the Prussian Saar, but
in the spring of 1904, the Gewerkverein leadership in the Ruhr sent trade
union secretary Johann Effert and its general secretary Adam Stegerwald
to the region.76 The ‹rst meetings to attract members were held in the central mining towns of Altenkessel, Püttlingen, and Dudweiler on 1 May,
and by June, the Gewerkverein had created eleven local branches with
about six hundred members. By October, these ‹gures had increased to
nineteen locals with about twelve hundred members, and by the end of the
year, after retaining Ludwig Buchheit as a local paid functionary, the Gewerkverein could claim four thousand Saar miners as members. In July
1905, the formation of a trade union cartel, which coordinated the activities of the locals and instituted courses for the training of union activists,
completed the organization of the Gewerkverein in the region. The latter
grew steadily during the prewar decade: by the beginning of 1911, the Gewerkverein had managed to organize 14,000 (or 20 percent) of the 50,802
miners employed by the Mining Of‹ce.
Like the Social Democrats, Christian union leaders in the Saar were
able to build their movement by organizing through local public institutions, including the industrial courts, sickness funds, and the deliberative
bodies in Saar mining. Already in 1905, Christian unionists were organizing for local Ortskrankenkassen and industrial court elections, not only to
secure some control over the management of these institutions, but also to
defeat Social Democratic candidates. They did this in cooperation with the
Catholic workers’ associations and other nonsocialist organizations,
including the Protestant workers’ associations. In 1909, the Christian
unions led efforts to create the Social Council of Nationalist Employees’
Organizations (Sozialer Ausschuss nationaler Arbeitnehmer-Organizationen), an avowedly antisocialist local formation, which included the
Protestant and Catholic workers’ associations and the liberal HirschDuncker unions and was designed largely to forge coalitions capable of
winning local elections to these bodies. By 1910, the Christian unions and
their allies claimed to have “elected out” some 228 Social Democratic representatives of the Ortskrankenkassen in the Saar and to have taken over
the sickness fund and the industrial court in Malstatt-Burbach, and they
were entertaining hopes of taking control over the Ortskrankenkassen in
Saarbrücken and St. Johann.77
Moreover, Christian union leaders exploited the status of Saar mining
as a state-owned and state-operated industry and its role as one of the

132

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

kaiser’s “model institutions” that established mechanisms for employee
representation in the “New Course” legislation of 1890–91. Accordingly,
they not only bene‹ted from the fact that nearly all Saar miners shared the
same employer and relatively uniform wages and working conditions across
the region; they also took advantage of the elective works councils (Ausschüsse) and the selection of security stewards (Sicherheitsmänner), institutions not available to workers in local private heavy industry and offering
miners opportunities to in›uence decisions about wages, social provisions,
and working conditions. As early as 1905, the Gewerkverein began to organize for elections to the works councils and for security stewards in Saar
mining, and it gradually turned the councils into sites from which to criticize
Mining Of‹ce policy during the prewar decade.78 This activity was aided by
the fact that crucial aspects of Mining Of‹ce policy were periodically aired
as public matters, as its budget was subject to debate and approval in the
Prussian Landtag—in sharp contrast to the conditions obtaining in local
private heavy industry. This meant, as the Mining Of‹ce chairman complained, that working conditions and wages in Saar mining were made public and debated by opposition parties, including the Center.79
The relative success of the Christian trade unions in the Saar therefore
owed as much to the speci‹c constellation of discursive relations and institutions that determined access to the local public sphere as it did to the
preponderance of Catholic workers in the region. Christian union leaders
sought legitimacy by emphasizing their loyalty to the kaiser and the
monarchical state and their commitment to moderate reform and proceduralist gradualism within the limits of “bourgeois society.” This meant
defending the interests of workers in the way other occupational associations represented the interests of their members, while af‹rming the basic
parameters—and the attendant inequalities and constraints—of the capitalist economy.80 Christian union leaders also formulated their aims in the
gendered moralizing discourse of social Catholicism, which converged
with the language of Protestant social reform after 1900. In an effort to
de‹ne themselves as the decent and lawful alternative to socialism and to
compete with the Catholic workers’ associations on the terrain of moral
instruction, Christian unions embraced a project that sought to immunize
members against the contagion of dissolute forms of popular culture. They
worked against the deleterious consequences of what Christian union
leaders called Klimbim, meaningless pastimes and entertainments sponsored by the proliferating Klimbimvereine (i.e., carnival, bowling, sports,
and conviviality clubs), as well as against the penchant for “trashy litera-

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

133

ture and pictures” and the immoderate enjoyment of alcohol, which constituted a “cancerous growth on the life of the Saar people.”81 Moreover,
the focal point of Christian union rhetoric was the “family wage” (which
de‹ned workers as “family fathers”) and its importance to the material
and moral well-being of the working-class family. According to a Gewerkverein leader speaking in 1907, the absence of a “family wage” meant
that workers’ wives were forced to seek paid employment outside the
home and to neglect their female obligation to “educate their children to
be orderly and productive members of human society.”82 Finally, the
Christian unions centered their approach on appeals to the public sphere
as an authorizing agency, and in response to charges that they represented
the “precursor to social democracy,” they appealed to the arbitrating force
of a reasonable Öffentlichkeit.83
This strategy was revealed in the weeklong Burbach steel strike of
June 1906, the ‹rst mass industrial action of Saar workers since the winter
of 1893.84 Led by Leonhard Wernerus from Aachen, the secretary of the
Christian Metalworkers’ Union (Christlicher Metallarbeiterverband
Deutschlands, hereafter CMV), the strike was aimed at improving the
wages and conditions for employees at the Burbach steelworks and securing the right of workers to join their own union. Wernerus and the strikers
adopted a strategy that centered on bringing “proof [of oppressive working conditions] before the public sphere” by means of an orderly presentation of grievances and attempting to send delegations, all of which were
rebuffed, to meet with factory director Edmund Weisdorff.85 This entailed
explicit attempts to distance the “reasonable” demands of the CMV, put
forward “only within the existing legal framework,” from the “revolutionary” aims of social democracy and to embrace a universal language of
“human rights” and citizenship for steelworkers over overtly confessional
and class languages of protest, in an effort to challenge the paternalist
forms of antiunion coercion at the steelworks.86 In addition, CMV leaders
formulated their demands in the gendered discourse of Christian labor,
which directly invoked the steelworker’s right to a “family wage” and
accepted the bourgeois links between masculinity and “reasonable” public
debate. By contrast with the dramatic crowd actions and self-mobilization
of women during the miner’s winter strike of 1893, the wives of Burbach
steelworkers were called to two or three separate meetings, during which
CMV leaders explained the importance of the union and urged the women
to convince their husbands to join it.87 Finally, Wernerus and other CMV
leaders attempted to appeal to “the public” in ways that counterposed

134

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

“citizens” (Bürger) to “workers” and implicitly accepted the ideological
workings and hierarchies of bourgeois Öffentlichkeit. In his speech before
a meeting of strikers on 8 June, Wernerus claimed, “The sympathies of the
citizenry (Bürgschaft) are with the workers. We want to make sure, therefore, that the struggle is carried out by maintaining order and discipline.”
During the same meeting, Franz Wieber, representing the national organization, referred to the formation of a ‹ve-member commission to negotiate with management as a demonstration to “the public” (Öffentlichkeit)
that “we seriously want peace and do not intend to damage the steelworks” with a long strike.88
Given these important areas of agreement with dominant de‹nitions
of moral and social order, it is not surprising that Christian union
demands were allowed into the existing ‹eld of public discourse in ways
that socialist claims were not. At the national level, the Christian unions
gradually won the support of prominent bourgeois social reformers, imperial ministers, and the kaiser himself. Largely under the direction of Adam
Stegerwald, the Christian unions established contacts with a wide range of
Protestant Christian Social organizations (under the direction of Adolf
Stöcker), Protestant and Catholic workers’ associations, nonsocialist
labor formations, and bourgeois social reformers associated with the Society for Social Reform, especially former Prussian commerce minister Hans
Berlepsch. The most concrete public expression of this emerging community of sentiment was the congress of nonsocialist workers held in Frankfurt in October 1903. Organized by the Christian Socials but dominated by
the Christian trade unions, the congress, which was followed by meetings
in 1907 and 1913, was designed to impress on the “public” and government
ministers the potential strength of the nonsocialist labor movement and to
call for speci‹c reforms, including the liberalization of the existing law of
association, legal corporate status for trade unions, and the establishment
of state-regulated works chambers composed of workers and employers.
Well received by many politicians and their supporters in the bourgeois
parties, including the Center, the National Liberal, and the left-liberal parties, the congress was praised by Arthur von Posadowsky-Wehner, imperial secretary of the interior, and the kaiser, who, via telegram, promised his
support and protection for the assembled Christian workers as an important “dam against social democracy.”89
Locally, the Christian unions were able, over time, to count on the
support of nearly all of the leading newspapers. By 1910, all six major

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

135

regional newspapers had opened up their pages to printed notices and
news announcements of Christian trade unions’ meetings and agendas.90
More striking, most of the major newspapers in Saarbrücken and St.
Johann—not only the Center-af‹liated Saarpost and St. Johann-Saarbrücker Volkszeitung, but also the liberal Saarbrücker Zeitung and the leftliberal St. Johanner Zeitung—supported the Christian union-led strike at
the Burbach steelwork in June 1906. Only the newspapers directly connected to heavy industry—especially the Neue Saarbrücker Zeitung and
the “factory newspapers” in places like Malstatt-Burbach, Völklingen,
and St. Ingbert—refused to tolerate the Christian trade unions.
Finally, the Mining Of‹ce’s policy shift after 1905 proved most decisive to the prospects of Christian unionism in the Saar. The move to a
position of neutrality in relation to the Christian trade unions brought an
end to the paternalistic harassment of “Christian-national” miners. It
meant that Christian unionists were allowed to hold meetings, publicize
their aims, and even read their own newspapers, along with Center Party
newspapers, in the mining dormitories and facilities.91 Indeed, Saar mining
of‹cials not only allowed the Gewerkverein openly to seek members and
publicize its demands; by 1913, they even recognized the Christian Miners’
Union as a viable antisocialist formation, one that had the virtue of at
least appearing to be a militant alternative to the socialist union. In a
report assessing the potential costs and bene‹ts of a company-sponsored
union, Saar mining of‹cials decided in favor of the Gewerkverein and
against the formation of a company, or yellow, union, arguing that the
former “manifests the necessary radicalism—even toward us—that will
keep the masses from going over to social democracy and allow it to combat Social Democracy successfully,” while “it is not so strong that it
believes it is capable of doing without our well-meaning neutrality or of
risking a strike without danger of self-destruction.”92
This cynical strategy points up the limitations of the Christian labor
movement and helps to explain its lack of success in the prewar Saar.
Despite the fact that Christian union leaders mobilized nearly 4,000 out of
the total of 4,480 employees of the Burbach steelworks during the June
strike, their strategy of moderate interest representation ended in limited
success, if not outright failure. The dispute was settled only with the intervention of two outside negotiators—the National Liberal Heinrich Boltz
and the Protestant pastor Nold—in view of Weisdorff’s refusal to negotiate directly with the union. In third-party negotiations, company of‹cials

136

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

only agreed to allow the striking workers to return to work if their jobs
had not been taken by “faithful” nonstrikers, and they refused to rehire
the ‹fty-six most active union organizers or to concede any general wage
or workplace demands. Their only formal concession was to acknowledge
the right of their employees to join a union, though they would not negotiate with any union of‹cials not employed in the factory, nor would they
“recognize any kind of obligation to negotiate with members of just any
organization.” They argued, “We will not, for example, hire Social Democrats or members of organizations that preach illegal breach of contract.”93 In this way, they were able to break the union completely. Subsequent attempts by CMV activists to organize steelworkers in nearby
Brebach, Bischmisheim, and Völklingen and to compete against newly
formed company unions at the Burbach, Völklingen, and Neunkirchen
steelworks failed.
The Christian Miners’ Union in the region was not very successful in
developing an organization capable of addressing matters of economic or
social inequality before the First World War. The Gewerkverein was never
even able to secure for its members higher wages, which, by contrast with
the early 1890s, lagged behind the wages of the Ruhr, Wurmrevier, and
Upper Silesia during the entire prewar period. After 1905, the Gewerkverein expanded its organization and attempted to engage the Mining
Of‹ce in debates over the reform of the miners’ sickness and pension
funds. Their petition, which they sent to the Mining Of‹ce, regional mining of‹cials in Bonn, and the Prussian Landtag, met with very limited success, as did their subsequent efforts to enhance the ef‹cacy of the mining
works councils. Indeed, in the face of the economic downturn and deteriorating wage situation from 1910 to 1912, the ‹ve petitions, with accompanying memoranda, that the Gewerkverein sent to the Prussian commerce
minister, the Prussian Landtag, and the local Mining Of‹ce secured only a
promise of a future family pension fund.94 While the Christian Miners’
Union continued to win recruits during this period, the strike it threatened
for December and January 1912–13 never materialized. After the mediation of National Liberal Party chairman Ernst Basserman, who won the
seat for Saarbrücken in 1912, the dispute ended with only a minor concession, in the form of a promise of future wage increases from the Mining
Of‹ce. Consequently, the Gewerkverein—opposed during these deliberations by the Catholic workers’ associations, whose leaders argued that
“public opinion” was not behind the strike—was hobbled by a mass exodus of its members.95

137

Public Life and Party Politics
The new civic associations, Catholic workers’ associations, Christian trade
unions, and Social Democratic organizations had more consequential and
lasting effects on the paternalist organization of public life and party politics in the region. The efforts of the civic associations to open up the public domain of municipal affairs were carried much further by Social Democrats, Catholic priests and Christian labor leaders, and Center supporters,
who began systematically to organize for council elections in the years
after 1903. The consequences of this mobilization, which also included the
Protestant workers’ associations, were dramatically illustrated in a number of subsequent public controversies. In Neunkirchen, Catholic leaders
successfully contested National Liberal in›uence over the town council
during the municipal elections of 1907—which “for the ‹rst time brought
party passions into the municipal council”—and ended the paternalist
practice of candidate preselection with the approval of the director of the
Stumm steelworks.96 Subsequent elections were contested by all parties,
and by 1910, the membership of the Neunkirchen municipal council
included Bartholomäus Koßmann (an aforementioned leader of the
Catholic workers’ associations) and even a miner.97 Perhaps more striking,
in December 1911, a coalition of Center and reform-liberal members of the
Saarbrücken municipal council prevailed over a coalition of industrial
paternalists, including Director Heinrich Köhl of the Burbach steelworks,
and granted a request submitted by the local SPD to use the main meeting
hall of Saarbrücken, the Saalbau, for a party meeting in January 1912.
After insisting that preventing the SPD from using the hall was no longer
“appropriate to the times,” the reform coalition effectively broke with the
paternalist organization of municipal affairs and public life.98
The proliferation of working-class associations, the Catholic workers’ associations, and the Christian trade unions also contributed to the
momentum of the Catholic Center Party as it held to its policy on the
social question and acted as spokesman for the interests of industrial
workers in years after 1900. In 1903, the leaders of the Center Party in Saarbrücken cast themselves as the representatives of the workers against the
employers, and their candidate Dr. Peter Muth supported the government’s proposed tariffs against the right wing of the party’s Reichstag
fraction, called for the formation of trade unions out of existing workers’
associations, and proposed unemployment support for workers. Against
the backdrop of a doubling of the Social Democratic vote, Muth took a

138

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

close second place to the National Liberal Boltz in the election. The “Hottentot” elections of 1907 were even more closely contested in the wake of
the Burbach strike, and party activists with connections to Saarpost even
pushed to have the Christian union secretary Wernerus selected as party
candidate. The church and Center Party hierarchy rejected this effort, but
their own candidate Dr. Strauss, who secured the support of Wernerus
and campaigned on behalf of workers, lost by only 1,448 votes in the closest election in the district of Saarbrücken. More dramatically, during the
Reichstag elections of 1912, the competing factions within the Center Party
reached an agreement by which the Christian trade union secretary and
miner Franz Sauermann from Duisburg would run as Center candidate in
Saarbrücken and the Catholic workers’ association secretary Koßmann
would run in Ottweiler. Koßmann, the nonmilitant labor leader who was
supported by the Catholic clergy, won the seat in Ottweiler and became
the ‹rst “worker candidate” to represent the interests of a political party in
the region.99
Finally, the rise of working-class associations and the social orientation of the Center Party, along with its electoral advances, pressured leaders of the National Liberal Party, long dominated by industrial paternalists
and their allies, to consider a new “social orientation”—a change that partially re›ected developments within the national organization, especially
after 1905, when the Stresemann and Young Liberal left wing began to
challenge the party’s industrialist right wing.100 After Stumm’s death in
1901 and the dissolution of the long-standing “cartel,” reform-minded liberals, including the Naumannite Protestant clergymen active in the mid1890s, leaders of the Protestant workers’ associations, organizers of the
newly formed liberal Hirsch-Duncker trade unions, and editors of the
Saarbrücker Zeitung, coalesced into a serious faction within the local
National Liberal Party.101 This faction was spearheaded after 1903 by the
Saar Young Liberals, who established a regional organization and sought
to challenge the industrialist domination of the local party by means of a
reformist program of imperialism, social welfare, trade union rights, and a
broad-based hostility toward political Catholicism.102 Led by the lawyer
Dr. Lanser and supported by Oberrealschule director and reform liberal
Dr. Maurer, the Young Liberals challenged the party establishment to give
up its intermittent and socially exclusive style and to bring workers “into
practical collaboration in the service of the National Liberal Party” by
recruiting working-class members and extending these efforts into some of
the industrial towns and villages after 1904.103 This prompted Boltz and the

Workers’ Associations, the Struggle over Öffentlichkeit, and the Crisis of Paternalism

139

National Liberals to expand the party’s permanent organization (which
comprised twenty-four separate electoral committees by 1906), hold regular meetings, and sponsor social events, to which even women were
invited.104 By the Reichstag election of 1907, party leaders were instructing
functionaries to attend diligently to the publication of electoral notices in
all local newspapers, the posting of placards on kiosks “on the streets” and
in taverns and businesses, and the distribution of “handbills to every house
in the districts for which your electoral association is responsible”: “The
cause will not be won by means of meetings, handbills, newspapers articles,
etc. alone,” party leaders insisted, “but will also involve above all the necessary and most conscientious detailed labor [Kleinarbeit], to which every
member of your electoral association must enthusiastically dedicate himself.”105 But the most visible sign of the National Liberal “turn to the left”
came in the wake of the Burbach steel strike,106 during which the two main
venues of reform liberalism, the Saarbrücker Zeitung and the St. Johanner
Zeitung, supported the cause of steelworkers. Heinrich Boltz even helped
to negotiate the end of the strike by calling on the director of the Burbach
steelworks to acknowledge his employees’ right to organize—a settlement
that paved the way for Dr. Maurer to de‹ne the workers’ right to organize
in nonsocialist trade unions as a central campaign issue during the Reichstag elections of January 1907. This orientation was generally upheld by
party leaders Ernst Bassermann, who visited the Saar during the elections
in 1907, and Gustav Stresemann, who visited during the run-up to the
Landtag elections in 1908, in order to hold the reformist and paternalist
wings of the party together.107
Most striking was the change in National Liberal electoral rhetoric
and practice between 1907 and 1912 and the new recognition of workers
during campaigns—a novel attempt to incorporate workers into the disinterested consensus of the “liberal Bürgertum.” During the Reichstag elections of 1907 and 1912, Saar National Liberals began allowing some workers and even Christian trade union leaders to speak during general voter
meetings.108 During the 1908 Landtag election, which was the occasion for
sharp clashes between the paternalist wing led by Boltz and the reform
wing led by the Young Liberal candidate Maurer, National Liberal miners
in Dudweiler held their own meeting in May in favor of the miner Pfordt
as National Liberal candidate, in an impassioned debate over the social
question and the worker’s right to organize. The miner Müller directly
challenged the electoral practices of Saar industrialists by calling for a
miner to represent the local “liberal citizenry.”

140

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

On the economic terrain, workers are still not able to achieve equal
rights in relation to a Weisdorff and a Röchling, so we want to
achieve this even more on the political terrain. We are not mindless
voters [Stimmvieh] but seek to be authors of political ideas and
demand that our concerns are clearly and conclusively recognized. It
is absolutely unacceptable that a Weisdorff lets Delegate Boltz give
speeches about the worker’s right to organize and then later throws
unionized workers out in the street. That is political hypocrisy.109
Moreover, in response to the Center Party’s strategy of putting forward
the “worker candidates” Koßmann and Sauermann for the Reichstag elections of 1912, the Young Liberals even proposed a worker candidate, the
blacksmith Pick who worked in the Fischbach colliery, for the Landtag
election of 1913. Though these attempts failed, largely because most
National Liberals could never accept a worker candidate, the candidacy
and victory of Ernst Bassermann in Saarbrücken in 1912 and the direct
appeals to workers were signs of dramatic changes within the local party
in relation to the worker question. In the end, this turn to the left within
the local National Liberal Party revealed most clearly the wider consequences of this period of working-class mobilization: the incipient collapse
of paternalism, both as a labor regime and a framework for public life, in
the Saar during the prewar decade.

chapter 5

The New Managerial Rationality and
the Racialization of Industrial Work

The fundamental reconstitution of Saar public life and the intensifying
contestation over the meanings and boundaries of Öffentlichkeit initiated
a process of ideological rearticulation that fundamentally transformed the
managerial discourses of Saar employers after 1900. The structural interconnections between company paternalism and public authority meant
that efforts to expand the conditions of Öffentlichkeit in the Saar necessarily, if indirectly, undermined the foundations of the paternalist factory
regime. But the formation of working-class counterpublics and new spaces
of opposition also enabled direct critiques of paternalist workplace organization after 1900. In response to Social Democratic, liberal reformist,
and Christian-national challenges to paternalism, Saar employers began
publicly and systematically to (re)de‹ne the nature of work and the relations between workers and employers in heavy industry. Abandoning or
reaccenting the central coordinates of paternalist labor policy, they formulated a new rationality of workplace management, centered on the regulation of workers’ bodies and the bioracial capacities of workers and
their families, which sought to improve labor “performance” (Leistung)
and overall productive ef‹ciencies in the racial and economic “struggle”
between nations and peoples. This new rationality was partially institutionalized and materialized in the architecture of Saar factories and in the
labor relations and social policies of Saar heavy industry after 1900.
These new technocratic schemes of “rational” workplace management, which sought to discover and direct the allegedly natural laws
immanent to human behavior and organizational forms, were part of a
141

142

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

general American and European phenomenon within large-scale industry
in the new era of mass production and global markets at the turn of the
century.1 They are usually grouped together under the label “scienti‹c
management” and associated with “Taylorism,” or the ideas of Frederick
Taylor, an American engineer whose theory of management based on the
systematic study of work tasks and the creation of optimal workplace conditions and incentives for labor productivity were discussed widely among
European engineers and industrialists.2 But these schemes emerged from
the writings of a broad array of engineers, employers and their representatives, social reformers, trade unionists, psychologists, sociologists, and
physiologists across North America and Europe and from a wider set of
concerns related to new divisions of labor and skill, the invention of new
wage systems and incentives, the bureaucratic reorganization of managerial hierarchies, the introduction of new technologies and mechanized
infrastructure, the reorganization of production processes, and the changing structures of the business enterprise as a “vertically” and “horizontally” integrated corporate structure after 1890.3 In this context, new technically trained managers undertook efforts to organize the industrial
workplace and the production process according to “impersonal” technical imperatives and to comprehend worker attitudes toward and physical
capacities for work on the basis of scienti‹c-technocratic considerations—
efforts that were visible before the First World War, to very different
degrees, in the U.S. electrical, chemical, and automobile industries; the
British engineering and metallurgical industries; the French mining and
automobile industries; and the German iron and steel, chemical, electrical,
and automobile industries.
Nevertheless, the new scienti‹c-technocratic orientation of industrial
management took many forms and cannot be reduced to one general,
ineluctable trend of “corporate” management in the modern industrial
era. In Germany, it evolved out of two distinctive bodies of formalized
knowledge: the “science of the factory” (Fabrikbetriebslehre or Fabrikbetriebskunde), or the production process; and the “science of work”
(Arbeitswissenschaft), focused on individual worker attitudes and capacities. It also evolved in the context of speci‹c political-ideological struggles
over the organization of work in the large-scale factory. These struggles
were shaped by the relatively greater concentration of German capital and
the strength of German employer organizations and their newly established research institutes or “think tanks,” in relation to organized labor;
the higher levels of state involvement in social welfare institutions for

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

143

industrial workers, especially after 1900; the increasing in›uence of reform
organizations and the parties in the Reichstag (the Center, the left liberals,
and the Young Liberal wing of the National Liberal Party), which could
in›uence industrial legislation; and, above all, the presence of Europe’s
largest and most well-organized socialist party, the SPD, and its af‹liated
unions. In their immediate con›ict after 1900 with the class languages of
socialism and, to a lesser extent, Christian trade unionism, Saar employers
developed their distinctive version of the new managerial rationality,
which articulated technocratic ambitions with biopolitical racism.

Rationalized Management and the New Science of Work
The turn to a new rationality of workplace management, especially in the
steel industry, eventuated from fundamental discursive shifts entangled
with a series of changes, underway since the 1890s, to the forms of business
organization, management structures and practices, procedures of cost
accounting, and workplace technology related to matters of “ef‹ciency”
and pro‹tability. It emerged out of a growing interest in (re)de‹ning the
economic and natural laws and properties governing labor relations and
industrial capitalism and drew on the generalizing systematicity of scienti‹c theory to produce a technocratic calculus of productive ef‹ciency
and workplace performance (Leistung) and scienti‹c representations of
the biophysical properties of labor and the capacities of individual workers, managers, and employers. But the timing of its emergence and consolidation as a discourse after 1900, its speci‹c range of citation, and its veiled
strategic claims suggest that this new managerial rationality should be
understood neither as an unmediated or entailed outcome of technical
imperatives and economic transformations nor as the inevitable application of scienti‹c thought to the autonomous structures and relations of the
industrial workplace. Rather, it is best understood as a response to competing discourses about workplace organization.
Saar and other German employers elaborated the scienti‹c categories
and assertions of this new rationality in ways that were designed
speci‹cally to debunk the de‹nitions of work and the factory and the
claims about the rights of workers and the most appropriate form of
industrial organization emanating from the ranks of Social Democrats,
bourgeois social reformers, and Christian unionists after the 1890s.
Despite their limited organizational gains and their modest, proceduralist

144

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

emphasis on securing the basic right to organize, Social Democrats
launched the most systematic critique of paternalist work relations, which
implicitly carried the utopian demand for the socialization of production
and made social democracy the ongoing target—and haunting fear—of
Saar industrialists. Bourgeois-liberal reformers, who found institutional
support within the Young Liberals and the moderate wing of the local
National Liberal Party, supported the formation of nonsocialist trade
unions and “codetermination” at the workplace and helped to undermine
paternalism partly from within, by invoking the paternalist aim of maintaining “peaceful relations between employer and employee” in order to
justify its aims. Christian labor leaders, mobilizing Saar workers on the
basis of a “class identity within a religious-ecclesiastical” framework, challenged Saar paternalism even more directly on its own terrain by reaccenting paternalist preoccupations with labor as a moral obligation, workplace harmony, appropriate familial order, and the male breadwinner
norm in their efforts to empower workers as “citizens” with “human
rights.”4 The accumulating pressure from workers and reformers in the
1890s and the trade union movements after 1903 turned industrial organization in the large-scale factory (Grossbetrieb) into an object of sustained
political-economic struggle and focused national debates on large-scale
productive relations and the general principles of workplace organization.
In this context, Saar employers deemed the new scienti‹c-technocratic
rationality of factory management both attractive and imperative.
They were able to draw on an existing ‹eld of discourse about the
organization of work in the large-scale industrial enterprise, expressed in
the writings of a diverse array of academics, reformers, social investigators, engineers and technicians, and employers. This ‹eld had evolved into
two discrete knowledges in Wilhelmine Germany: the “science of the factory” and the “science of work.” The newly emergent science of the factory
sought to “master and elaborate further upon the experiences gained
heretofore through [managerial] praxis” and to articulate, “by means of
scienti‹c method,” the principles and relations by which a factory was
ef‹ciently and productively organized.5 It produced a body of “management literature,” which began in the late 1860s as a series of isolated texts
concerned with cost-accounting procedures but evolved into a dense ‹eld
of knowledge after 1900, born largely by engineers and technical “experts”
dedicated to de‹ning and propagating general rules of industrial “organization.” The latter were articulated in new technical journals—such as
Organisation. Fachblatt der leitenden Männer in Handel und Industrie,

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

145

Werkstattstechnik. Zeitschrift für Anlage und Betrieb von Fabriken und für
Herstellungsverfahren, and System. Zeitschrift für moderne Geschäfts- und
Betriebskunde—and in the activities of trade organizations, especially the
Association of German Engineers (Verein deutscher Ingeneure) and its
own journals, Zeitschrift des VDI and Technik und Wirtschaft. These new
publications and organizations aimed for and constructed an “interested
public” of not only technical writers removed from the immediate domain
of production but also factory directors, managers, and white-collar
workers interested in the new science of workplace organization. Research
related to speci‹c factories as well as essays on cost accounting, bookkeeping, factory organization and communication, and general methods
of labor management and payment schemes, including the time and
motion studies and wage calculations associated with Taylorism, thereby
entered into the journals of heavy industry and into the writings of publicists associated with the CVDI and other industrial organizations.6 The
new science of industrial management thus challenged antitheoretical
paternalist understandings of work and factory organization, which
focused on the unique economic talents and moral qualities of the
employer and the workforce and the particular needs of and customary
practices in the “private” individual factory. Indeed, the new science proposed generalizing theories about the factory and the production
process—its properties and the laws governing its operation—to a wider,
interested public.7
In the Saar, these “scienti‹c” understandings of industrial organization informed several fundamental changes to the iron and steel ‹rms and
glass ‹rms after the mid-1890s. First, they helped to displace the previous
model of paternalist factory management (which involved the factory
owner in direct relations with workers), by underscoring the potentialities
of the limited liability ‹rm and joint-stock company. The Burbach and
Dillingen steelworks were already established as joint-stock companies—
though the latter under the controlling in›uence of Stumm—before 1890,
but new strategies of capital formation and organizational ef‹ciency led to
the transformation of nearly all leading Saar ‹rms into limited liability
companies—the Neunkirchen steelworks in 1903, the Halberg steelworks
in 1908, and the Röchling steelworks, the Vopelius glassworks, the Reppert glassworks, and the Wentzel glassworks shortly thereafter.8 This not
only entailed the diminution of the “family spirit” allegedly governing earlier forms of paternalist business organization;9 it also curbed the direct
in›uence of the company owner, as the factory direction itself was divided

146

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

into technical and ‹nancial sections and increasingly operated on the basis
of regular rounds of managerial consultation. Second, the new scienti‹c
understandings informed the bureaucratic-technocratic reorganization of
managerial structures of Saar industrial ‹rms. Following a pattern manifested in industrial concerns throughout Germany and Europe, Saar ‹rms
evolved managerial hierarchies that not only departed from the paternalist concentration of control in the ‹gure of the factory owner or director;
they also weakened the authority of the foreman (Werkmeister) on the
shop ›oor. In the place of more or less unmediated and command-style
management practices, an expanded and attenuated factory hierarchy
became the norm—a transformation manifested in the dramatic proliferation of technical personnel and white-collar clerical staff, whose numbers
increased in Saar factories proportionately more than any other employees after 1900,10 and of new of‹ces and bureaus designed to perform a wide
array of functions, including bookkeeping and cost accounting, sales and
marketing, the procurement and allocation of raw materials and equipment, the calculation of wages and payments systems, the policing of factory grounds and personnel, the administration of social welfare programs, and the organization of company publicity and public relations.11
In this context, the “Werkmeister system,” in which a foreman directed
each workshop or section in a factory and distributed tasks among his
workers and set wage levels according to his experience with the ultimate
approval of the factory director, increasingly gave way to rational-bureaucratic systems of wage calculation directed by engineers and technical and
‹nancial experts. This process was enabled by the systematic reorganization of procedures for setting wages and by the introduction of new practices and technologies, including ‹ling systems and work cards, replacing
the older, workbook system. This allowed direct comparison between old
and new work tasks and the abstract-rational, rather than customary or
experiential, determination of workers’ wages and tasks.12 The determination of job categories, work tasks, and wages were thereby subjected to a
technocratic calculus of rational measurement and to systemic concerns
about ‹nancial management under the auspices of an internal factory
bureaucracy composed of technicians and clerks.13
Third, the new science of the factory encouraged the introduction of
new payment schemes, especially in the iron and steel industry, which
increasingly subjected production workers to the anonymous pressures of
bureaucratized decision making and wage incentive systems—technologies that privileged impersonal, individualizing, and internalized norms of

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

147

worker self-discipline over the direct commands of factory management.
This was most obviously re›ected in the growing prevalence of the “accord
system,” or piece rates, and the “premium wage.” The accord system ‹xed
the amount of a worker’s wage according to quantity of output produced;
each individual worker was then paid differentially according to a particular set calculus or hierarchy of tasks. After having displaced the hourly
wage for most categories of workers by the 1890s, the accord system was
enhanced by the “premium wage” system, which came into comprehensive
use around the beginning of the twentieth century. The latter comprised a
minimum base wage and a variable component hitched to the level of
labor productivity—a form of wage incentive that encouraged workers to
intensify their individual output.14 These forms of payment were devised in
the context of the complex restructuring of pay and skill levels in the metallurgical industries that took place after the 1890s. As Thomas Welskopp
demonstrates, pay levels among workers underwent processes of both
homogenization and differentiation: overall differences between the most
skilled and least skilled workers narrowed, but the gradations of difference
between pay levels and within broad job categories proliferated.15 This
process was directly related to the fundamental shift in the overall composition of the labor force in the Saar steel industry during the 1890s, when
the combination of artisanal workers (e.g., puddlers and smiths) and
unskilled workers gave way to a combination of skilled workers, unskilled
or casual laborers, and a majority of new, semiskilled workers. The overall dilution of skill was registered in the proliferation of job titles among
Saar wage earners—the Röchling steelworks reported over 150 categories
of work in its various plants (i.e., the blast furnaces, the steelworks, the
rolling mills, and the metalworking and ironworking shops) in 1909—and
their apparent irrelevance to actual tasks performed.16
Finally, these changes to factory hierarchy and management were
associated with the introduction of new machinery, workplace technologies, and production processes (particularly in the iron and steel, metalworking, and glass industries), which also undermined the “personal”
dimensions and direct managerial relations of the paternalist labor regime.
The manufacturing “system” of Saar iron and steel ‹rms entered into a
process of qualitative transformation in which the system of centralized,
partially mechanized, and serial production, which prevailed since the
1880s, gave way to a system of decentralized integrated production during
the prewar decade. The latter, as Thomas Welskopp demonstrates in
excellent detail for steelworks elsewhere in Germany, was characterized by

148

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

increased “›exibility of production levels, hierarchization of manufacturing processes, and simultaneity of production ›ows.”17 It was made possible by the introduction of new machinery and technologies (including
cranes, lifts, ramps, and conveyors, which were increasingly powered by
electricity) and the general spatial and architectonic recon‹guration of
Saar steel factories after the turn of the century. As a comparison of the
architectural designs of the Burbach steelworks of 1881 and 1906 illustrates, the rationalized industrial concern came into being with the vast
expansion of industrial plants and the construction of multiple rolling
mills, steelworks, workshops, and administrative-technical of‹ces (including a research laboratory), connected by new conveyors and transport systems that traversed the entire complex of the factory grounds.18 Similarly,
the Röchling concerns expanded into a vast campus of independent factory plants and sections linked by new systems of transport after 1900,
including a workshop for motorized lathe, drilling, and planing machines;
a construction and carpentry section; an ironworking shop; an equipment
storeroom; a chemical laboratory; and an electric power plant.19 This
architecture was the product of the new imperatives associated with decentralized and simultaneous ›ow production, which brought the qualitative
transformation of the internal workings and processes of the paternalist
factory and rendered the modest, localized, and centralized architecture of
the paternalist enterprise a thing of the past.20
The second and related ‹eld that contributed to the new managerial
rationality was the new science of work, which involved the systematic
study of the relationship between human beings and the mechanics of
industrial labor and developed as a European-wide phenomenon in the
1890s. In Germany, it emerged as a cross-disciplinary ‹eld of research,
evolving out of the natural and social sciences, such as biology, medicine,
psychiatry, physiology, and sociology. Its most preeminent practitioners
were the physiologists Otto Fischer, Christian Wilhelm Braune, Nathan
Zuntz, and Ludwig Max Rubner; the psychologists Emil Kraepelin and
Hugo Münsterberg; and reformers and sociologists associated with the
Verein für Sozialpolitik, including Max Weber, Alfred Weber, Gustav
Schmoller, Heinrich Herkner, and Marie Bernays. In their very different
ways, these academics and investigators examined mechanical operations
in the workplace, the muscles and movements of the human body, the “psychic processes” of the human mind, and the attitudes of workers, subjecting
all these factors to extensive laboratory investigation, photographic studies, and quantitative and qualitative social-scienti‹c measurement.21

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

149

The result of these studies, as Anson Rabinbach makes clear, was a
powerful and pervasive scienti‹c representation of labor as the “expenditure and deployment of energy,” an objectively quanti‹able physical force
expressed variously in nature, the machine, and the human body.22 By
contrast with earlier discourses about labor, which stressed its moral and
spiritual dimensions, work was now universalized as a category of energy
and framed within a wider scienti‹c calculus that emphasized the physical
economy of labor power (Arbeitskraft). Thus the science of work shifted
attention from the moral properties of labor and the laborer to the physical tasks of work and the physiological and psychological capacities of the
laborer’s body. It became preoccupied with the human body’s psychophysical capacities and limits—the biological foundations of exertion
and fatigue—as experienced by the laborer on the shop ›oor.23
This new scienti‹c turn in discourses about the factory and industrial
work structured a wide range of politically diverse knowledge about the
labor process, but its vocabulary and conceptual apparatus proved especially attractive to a group of economists and academically trained publicists associated with the organized public relations efforts of German
heavy industry after 1900. Conservative intellectuals eagerly embraced the
putatively nonpolitical and value-free claims of science in an effort to challenge what they viewed as the “moralistic” assumptions and reformist bias
of the leading professors of German political economy (i.e., the so-called
Kathedersozialisten, or “socialists of the chair”), the German labor movement, and state-sponsored Sozialpolitik. From the ranks of academia, the
two critical ‹gures in this industry-friendly scienti‹c research were the
University of Breslau professor Julius Wolf, who began publishing scholarly studies and newspaper articles critical of social reform in the 1890s
and expanded these efforts with the creation of the Journal for Social Science (Zeitschrift für Sozialwissenschaft, hereafter ZfS), which he founded
in 1898; and the University of Frankfurt economist Ludwig Pohle, who
received the ‹nancial support of heavy industry and published a number
of theoretical works on political economy and who took over Wolf’s editorship of the ZfS in 1910.24 The second most important center of this
activity formed around University of Rostock economist Richard Ehrenberg, whose close ties to heavy industry went back to the 1890s, when he
was director of the Commercial Collegium in Altona. Ehrenberg subsequently linked his academic ambitions with the interests of German
employers, through his research projects on the Krupp steelworks in Essen
and the Siemens electrical ‹rm in Berlin; his journal, Thünen-Archiv,

150

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

begun in 1905; and his research center, the Institute for Precise Economic
Research, created in 1909 and ‹nanced by the CVDI.25
Finally, the academically trained industry spokesman and Pan-German Alexander Tille, who succeeded Stumm as the managing director of
the main industrial organizations of the Saar in 1903, created the third
important site of publicistic activity dedicated to the interests of heavy
industry. Shortly after his arrival, Tille reorganized the editorial of‹ces of
the Saar industry newspaper and orchestrated its redesign, established a
local business library and archive, and launched three important publication series designed to respond to the claims of the German labor movements, social reformers, and state social policy. These included Südwestdeutsche Wirtschaftsfragen, Südwestdeutschen Flugschriften, and
Sozialwirtschaftliche Zeitfragen, which published book-length essays dedicated solely to de‹ning the properties and laws and relations governing
the industrial workplace and the global capitalist economy and combating
socialism in “all its forms.” Tille, who was a member of the Pan-German
League and the Free Conservative Party, was a tireless publicist on behalf
of Saar and German heavy industry. He served as assistant to Axel Bueck,
chairman of the CVDI, from 1901 to 1903; and after taking up his position
in the Saar, he remained a member of the CVDI’s executive committee,
where he subsequently pushed for the creation of private “academies for
the schooling of agitators and teachers,” for the purpose of training speakers to propagandize on behalf of heavy industry.26 As the leading representative of Saar industrial organizations, Tille spoke for Saar industrialists generally and was instrumental in articulating the new ideologies of
work and factory order in the region.27
In their different ways, this new cohort of conservative academics and
theorists attempted to ground German political economy and workplace
management more ‹rmly and “objectively” in the methods and “discoveries of the natural sciences.”28 In their evolving corpus of “objective” economic theory, they de‹ned work both as a product of energy (Kraft) or
drive (Trieb) and as a process involving the transformation of nature into
goods of value according to the dictates of a “productive goal” and “the
application of technical processes for the achievement of that goal.”29 In
this process, according to Wolf, the industrial economy had produced
three different forms of human labor: “creative” (entrepreneurial), “dispositional” (administrative and managerial), and “executive” (manual)
labor. Each form of productive activity was based on varying levels of
“physical, deliberative, intellectual, imaginative, and technical talent,”

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

151

though the clearest distinctions were between “mental” and “manual”
labor.30 This opposition between the mental and manual dimensions of
work, linked to the emphasis on the centrality of entrepreneurial or creative intention, explicitly served to refute reformist and union claims
about the importance of wage labor and to elaborate a new vision of labor
hierarchy in the modern factory. Thus Ehrenberg argued that the growing
size and complexity of the “modern industrial enterprise,” which was measured in terms of its division of labor and the application of machines and
technology to the manufacturing process, rendered managerial skills the
decisive motor of modern industry. Such “intellectual labor” was far more
important than manual labor, which played only a minor and increasingly
insigni‹cant role in production.31 Tille also privileged the “mental” labor
of the employer, the “bearer” of the “productive economy,” over the manual labor of the worker (Handkraft), since the latter is “a muscle power like
animal muscle power and might be capable of nothing other than the latter, namely, the ability to carry out movements.”32 In this scheme, the
employer appeared as the truly “creative force” in society, since only the
presence of entrepreneurial intention created work in the ‹rst place: other
“operations of manual energy,” such as play, sport, exercise, or “horsing
around” (Unfug), lacked direction and were not, strictly speaking, work.
“The ‘work’ of the factory laborer,” Tille maintained, “is not at all produced by the bearer of labor power [Handkraft] . . . but by [the employer]
who prescribes what the worker has to do.”33 In this process of refuting the
claims of social reformers, trade unionists, and Social Democrats in the
language of “science,” the ideologists for German heavy industry universalized work, the worker, and the employer, now understood in terms of a
general category of producer (Unternehmer).
Both the scienti‹c conception of work as a biophysical property and
the categorization of work according to the varying and hierarchical functions of workers, managers, and employers were increasingly visible in the
language and practice of German employers in heavy industry. In the
Saar, especially after the arrival of Tille, this change was particularly evident in the local industry press, in industry-sponsored publications, and in
the general reorientation of employer politics. As early as 1901, even before
Tille’s arrival, articles in the weekly Neues Saarbrücker Gewerbeblatt
about the development of factory industry in Germany linked the fate of
German business to the development of machine technology and the ability to attract high-quality Arbeitskräfte (labor power) or Handkräfte (hand
power), terms routinely invoked in reports of the Saar Chamber of Com-

152

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

merce, company brochures, and Saar industry press articles after 1905.34
Workers were now increasingly de‹ned in terms of physical properties,
production factors measured and evaluated according to their biological
and mental “capacities” for labor, which resulted in assumptions about
the ef‹ciency and performance of workers and machines as interchangeable components in the manufacturing process. A 1910 report from the
Saar Chamber of Commerce, for example, described the bene‹ts of new
machinery in terms of the reduction or “saving of Handkraft,” and a company brochure from 1905 assessed the “performance capacity” (Leistungsfähigkeit) of coal-washing machinery in a steel factory in the same way
that it discussed the labor of individual workers.35 In contrast to the primarily moralizing reference to the intimate relations within a company
“family” ‹gured in paternalist discourse, this new economic and biological
calculus recast the workplace as the site at which machines and men came
under the direction of the employer, or the bearer of “intellectual power,”
and were harnessed to a “productivist will” and toward a “productivist
goal.”36 The critical function of the employer now involved assessing the
physical and mental qualities of the labor force from the “productive-economic” (kraftwirtschaftlich) standpoint.
He must ‹x the wage high enough to attract the laborers [Handkräfte]
that he needs. He must try to attract the best labor power that he can
maintain at the given level of wages. He must ‹nd the means to place
each [worker] in the position in which the laborer’s capabilities are
best exploited; he must encourage the worker to perform at the highest level he is capable of; and he must know how to preserve the
worker in order to maintain his labor power as long as possible.37
The new workplace calculus meant paying attention to the abilities, skills,
and physical limits of different workers performing varying tasks in the
factory; and it meant restructuring the workplace by ‹nding the appropriate ‹t between workers and their jobs, by instituting a suf‹cient number of
work breaks, and by installing hygienic facilities to maintain the physical
health of workers.38 Labor policy in Saar heavy industry, in other words,
was recon‹gured around the notion of the laborer as an agent of physical
force, whose physiological capacities, general conditions of health, and
functional relationship to the tasks before him or her were the principal
concerns of the employer.
Perhaps the most revealing expression of this managerial rationality

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

153

was the set of factory work rules published by Saar industry in 1913. In a
striking contrast with the work rules and “disciplinary regulations”
favored by Stumm and other paternalist employers from the 1870s to the
1890s, with their excessive concern with workers’ morals and political
activities and their assumption of a tutelary posture for employers, the
new “model work rules of Saar industry” of 1913 stressed the contractual
aspects of employer-employee relations, omitted any mention of the outside activities of workers, and limited the direct authority of the employer
to the workplace. The only reference to “political, religious, and trade
union activities” came in clause 75, which prohibited the collection of
money, the distribution of handbills, and any discussions, meetings, or
assemblies related to workers’ organizations within the factory workplace
or on company property—a clear retreat from earlier paternalistic claims
on the right to control workers’ trade union and political activity in the
community and at home.39 The new rules also de‹ned the wage relationship between employer and employee in strictly functional and legalistic
terms: the process of managerial instruction and consultation and the procedures for addressing workers complaints were described in terms of the
hierarchy of competencies and “instances” within the factory. In a turn
away from the “personal” contacts between factory owner and worker,
realized most visibly in Stumm’s weekly of‹ce hours, the new work rules
elaborated a “process for lodging complaints” that followed a strict managerial hierarchy: “It is not permissible,” the model statutes intoned, “to
come without invitation to the top factory management.”40 In addition,
the new model rules assimilated the terms and language of “rational-scienti‹c” management: they rested on an understanding of work relations,
wage scales, and company bene‹ts as products of the interaction between
economic laws and the function, use, and “performance” of Handkraft.
Section 91 described the “contractual obligations [Leistungen] of the
employer.”
For the faithful and precise ful‹llment of his occupational duties in
the factory, the wage earner is provided a wage, which differs according to the nature of the task and is set by scale according to level of
performance [Leistung]. The wages of individual plants are determined conventionally but will change from time to time as the relationship between supply and demand affects a speci‹c kind of labor
[Handkraft]. They are valid as long as they have not been expressly
changed by the employer [Unternehmer]. . . . Some come in the form

154

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

of daily wages, some in piece rates, some as daily wages with performance bonuses. In addition to these, there are bonuses for punctuality, bonuses for consistency [Regelmäßigkeit], bonuses for matter-offact ef‹ciency [Nüchternheitsprämien], according to the determination
of the respective postings, as well as bonuses for expertise [Sachprämien] through participation in welfare programs. The kind of
wage a worker receives will be speci‹cally negotiated with each individual worker.41
Finally, as a “model” set of guidelines devised in anticipation of
upcoming legislation related to work rules throughout Germany, the new
work rules embraced the generalizing dimensions of the new managerial
rationality. Tille, listed as “editor” (Bearbeiter), had been charged with the
task of publishing the new rules as a model for all Saar ‹rms, by the leading industrial organizations of the Saar—the VWGWISI; the SGVDESI;
and the Employers’ League of Saar Industry (Arbeitgeberverband der
Saarindustrie), formed in 1904—and their leaders, including Louis Röchling, Edmund Weisdorff, Richard Vopelius, Dr. Hallwachs of the Wendel
glass factory, factory director Müller of the Stumm concerns, and factory
director Saeftel.42 The rules were published in the series Südwestdeutsche
Flugschriften and thus designed to appeal to a wider “public” beyond the
individual factory or even the Saar region. In this way, the new model
work rules were the collective product of consultations among Saar industrialists, as opposed to the private individualized concern of each factory
owner; and they were premised on the scienti‹c-technocratic claim to
describe general properties and functional imperatives that allegedly governed relations between workers and employers in all business enterprises.
No longer reducible to the personal qualities of the individual employer,
practical considerations, and local particularities, the organization of
work in the large-scale factory was now understood in terms of generally
valid and scienti‹cally derived laws related to the mental and physical
capacities of employers, managers, and workers.

Biology, Race, and Industrial Labor
The growing interest in the rational workplace management and technocratic managerial strategies articulated with newly emergent bioracial theories and assumptions about work and production in heavy industry in the

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

155

decade after the turn of the century. This process coincided with the formation and growing popularity of new ‹elds of knowledge, such as eugenics and racial hygiene, concerned with the rational management of population size and strength and the healthy reproduction of the German
nation or “race.” It was part of a broader tendency, contested by confessional, liberal, and Social Democratic reform discourses, toward the “biologization” of the social, which pervaded the political culture of the nationalist middle classes in late Wilhelmine Germany and reoriented a wide
range of disciplinary knowledges and political ideologies around questions
of race, production, and reproduction.43 In the Saar, the turn to “rational”
management brought new preoccupations with the physical properties of
the individual worker, the bioracial composition and activities of the
worker’s family, and the biopolitical relationships between the worker, the
working-class family, and the wider health and well-being of the German
“national body” (Volkskörper).
The most systematic connections between work, biology, and race
were made in the evolving discourse of conservative political economists
and employers in the decade before 1914. In attempts to ground economy
theory in the “spirit of modern science” and especially in biology, Adolf
Weber and the aforementioned group of right-wing ideologists—that is,
Wolf, Pohle, and Tille—helped develop hereditarian and biological understandings of labor in which work became more than the expression of
energy and physiological factors per se; it was also the product of innate
“capacity” and “talent” (Begabung). According to Wolf, the capacity for
creative, organizational, and manual forms of labor lay in the varying and
inherited physical and intellectual talents of the individual, which were distributed unevenly throughout the population: the masses were mainly composed of the less “gifted” (i.e., manual laborers), while the “creatively
gifted” (i.e., employers and entrepreneurs)—those with the most “value”—
constituted an increasingly smaller percentage of the population.44 According to the Pan-German Tille, this “natural economic diversity” of
humankind meant that individual workers were capable of varying degrees
of job “performance” (Leistung), and the quality of each individual’s performance in the realm of productive labor became the standard measure of
the individual’s innate capabilities and “competence,” as well as the primary reason for rewarding some workers with higher wages and advancement within the factory and maintaining others at low wage levels.45
In this scheme, all aspects of productive and social life were ordered
around what were deemed the essential biological—and therefore gender

156

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

and racial—hierarchies of nature. According to Tille, in the “productive
(or pro‹t) economy,” competition among men resulted in a social hierarchy determined on the basis of inherited abilities and job performance.
The top of this hierarchy, far above the “broader masses,” was occupied
by the “social aristocracy” of biological endowment and achievement. In
the productive economy, the ‹gure of the employer was the true “social
aristocrat,” the “man who under his own steam and his own responsibility
and liability confronted the dizzying array of economic conditions and
wrestled from them a pro‹t or a loss.”46 Moreover, in the “savings economy” of the household, argued Tille, the “natural meritocracy of mental
and physical attributes arranges itself . . . in a way that subordinates the
woman to the will of the man and the children to the will of both parents.”47 In this view, the husband-father was best equipped to take on the
risks and duties associated with ensuring the economic survival of the family unit, and the wife-mother was responsible for the continued biological
reproduction of the family.
Finally, this discourse extended these biological, gendered, and labor
hierarchies to the spectrum of “races,” in a world allegedly founded on the
interarticulations between race and capitalism. According to Julius Wolf,
the “structures of the world economy” and the economic struggle among
the nations were consequences of “racial characteristics,” the “product of
the blood mixture out of which nations had been created.”48 The Pan-German Tille, more than any other right-wing intellectual during this period,
similarly situated the dynamics of modern factory production and industrial labor within the context of the international “struggle for existence”
between the “races.”49 In this ideological framework, the rational, masculine, and advanced intellectual qualities of the European “master races”
(Herrenvölker) were counterposed with the lesser developed, “feminine,”
and animal-like qualities of non-European peoples. In the realm of work
and “productive ef‹ciency” (Leistungsfähigkeit), therefore, the “indo-Germanic race” and the white races in general were deemed racially superior to
the “Mongol,” the “Negro,” the “Australoid,” and the “Indian” races.
This superiority was measured in terms of the higher levels of “entrepreneurial spirit” and “commercial sense,” the advanced intellectual and organizational talents, the enhanced disposition to save and economize, and the
more pronounced technical skills, “nimbleness,” and physical dexterity of
the Europeans. By contrast, the Mongols (i.e., the Chinese and Japanese)
were thought to possess only a “large measure of imitative talent” and “little sense for innovation in mechanical labor.” The Chinese in particular

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

157

were thought to lack the qualities and discipline for savings and the accumulation of wealth, and it was expected that their excessive “desire to play
games of chance” and penchant for “sexual excess” and for dissolute
behaviors, such as smoking and opium use, would permanently keep them
in poverty. The “Negro” and the “Australoid” were deemed closer to “animals, who eat as much as possible and work as little as possible.”50
Despite their racist condescension, these judgments and schemes of
classi‹cation were expressed in a wider discourse of political economy that
rested on fear of global economic competition. This was perhaps most visible in representations of certain East Asian peoples, such as the Chinese,
who were portrayed as virtual automatons in their practically inhuman
capacity for unending hard labor, and the Japanese, who were viewed as
clever imitators.51 But this fear also generally informed expansionist
demands for access to world markets and the acquisition of colonial possessions in places like Africa, especially among the ranks of German heavy
industry, as the critical means by which to sustain the necessary conditions
of capital accumulation. In this sense, the racism of employers articulated
fears about the productivity of individual German ‹rms and industries
and demands for imperialist expansion and colonial dispossession in the
increasingly competitive environment of an expanding and globalizing
industrial capitalism.
In this context, German industrialists framed their connections
between race, gender, and work in a political economy increasingly
grounded in social Darwinian conceptions of evolution and race struggle
in the decade before 1914. This trend was evident in the 1900 Krupp essay
competition on racial hygiene, in the publicistic activities of Krupp director and press magnate Alfred Hugenberg, and in the growing currency of
racial-nationalist terms and appeals in the press organs of German heavy
industry, where references to “racial pride” and “race struggles” appeared
with growing frequency during the ‹nal prewar years.52 But it was most
visible in the writings of Saar industry spokesman Tille. Perhaps more systematically than others, Tille imagined economic life as the central realm
of human activity, grounded in nature and operating in accordance with
the biological struggle over the “means of existence” and the law of “natural selection.” Each individual man, according to Tille,
is conceived and born like the animal and can only prosper and maintain himself when he succeeds in securing the necessary means of existence in the long run. This happens in the productive economy, in

158

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

which he performs economically pro‹table work for which there is a
need. This work might be pleasant or unpleasant; he must do it just
the same, if he wants to ful‹ll his ‹rst existential obligation and make
it through life.53
The workings of the industrial economy therefore mirrored conditions in
the animal world. Economic life, Tille claimed, was “unmerciful,” “without sympathy, hard and cruel.” It “recognized only forces, not opinions,”
and it knew “nothing of virtues and earnings.” It knew only the innate
“aptitude” and “lack of aptitude” of the individual.54
Accordingly, work and productive life became the critical terrain of
evolutionary change and the development of racial ‹tness. In the realm of
productive labor and economic competition, individuals could realize
their inherited capabilities. The workplace, according to this view, was an
arena of ceaseless competition between differently endowed individuals
capable of varying levels of job performance (Leistung). Those capable of
higher levels of performance—employers and managers—represented the
most racially “‹t,” while lower-level clerks and wage earners ‹lled out the
ranks of the less “‹t.” Moreover, the industrial economy provided the “‹t
with considerably better conditions and encourages their propagation,
since it is unable to extend its generative power to the un‹t.”55 The result
of this interaction between biology and unfettered productive relations
would be the privileging of the social aristocrat of productive labor and
the gradual improvement of the German Volkskörper.56
Yet the “productive economy” interacted with the “household savings economy” in ways critical to the operation of natural biological laws.
First, the gender order of the household economy ensured that women
would be available to give birth to and nurture the young; they would be
able to function as the caretakers of the future generation. Second, “the
orderly, regular life of the husband in the house always had a positive
effect on the concentration of his powers [Kräfte] and the increase in his
labor ef‹ciency [Leistungsfähigkeit].” Finally, the combination of risks
and responsibilities associated with setting up the household—the existential matters related to family support and maintenance—acted as a constant “inducement to greater effort.” As such, they sharpened the skills
and drive of the husband-father and better equipped him for the wider
struggle in the productive economy.57
This turn toward hereditarian and evolutionary notions of race struggle in the discourse of German employers was linked to the shifting rela-

159

tions between unions, employers, and the state, as well as the changing
political debate over state social policy after 1900. During the decade
before 1914, leading sectors of German heavy industry, especially the large
extractive and capital goods sectors represented by the CVDI, grew
increasingly restless with the expanding in›uence of the labor movement
(both socialist and Christian), the impressive success of the Social Democratic Party in the 1903 elections, and the professed reluctance of the imperial government to introduce repressive labor legislation in the Reichstag.
Above all, German heavy industrialists focused their attacks on the
expanding scope of state regulation of the factory workplace and
Sozialpolitik. The Bismarckian social insurance schemes (i.e., the sickness,
accident, and old age and disability programs) and the mechanisms established for workplace arbitration (i.e., works councils, industrial courts,
and the proposed chambers of work) were increasingly deemed overly
costly, invasive, and burdensome to employers. The sickness funds, work
councils, and industrial courts in particular had been, according to this critique, abused by workers, who took advantage of the insurance bene‹ts in
illegal ways, and by the socialist and Christian union organizers, who had
contested elections to their governing boards, turned them into mechanisms of union agitation, and used them to press claims against employers.
Moreover, the CVDI criticized the way in which social insurance schemes
had encouraged workers increasingly to claim bene‹ts as their legal right,
rather than to view them as paternalist offerings from a benevolent state.58
Once among the leading advocates of state social welfare, Saar
employers (along with many other leaders of German heavy industry in
the CVDI) now criticized its reformist foundations, claiming that it privileged social and ethical factors over economic, biological, and racial considerations. In the Saar, attempts by Christian and socialist unions to
establish works councils, collective wage agreements, and unemployment
funds for workers and to contest elections to local sickness insurance
boards as early as 1903 were dismissed as “economic moralism,” a dangerous attempt to impose ethical criteria or an arti‹cial egalitarian vision on
an industrial workplace shaped by natural economic forces and biological
and racial laws of inequality.59 In general, Tille argued, reform measures
tended to extend bene‹ts to the least productive and least valued members
of society, those lesser humans who, “through gradual dissipation” and
degeneration, had begun their “descent to the level of swine” and would
soon “die out.”60 In addition, opponents argued that excessive social
insurance bene‹ts for all industrial workers would end in the “incapacita-

160

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

tion” of the wage-earning classes, since such material guarantees would
encourage “thoughtless living, indebtedness, a lack of concern for the
future, and the notion that savings were not necessary.” State welfare provision, according to this critique, undermined the skills necessary for
workers to manage their household economies and to attain economic
independence.61 In this view, state welfare, by extending protection and
bene‹ts to the biologically “un‹t” and by undermining the capabilities of
the “‹t,” violated the law of natural selection, inhibited the development
of the social aristocracy of work, and threatened the racial health of the
nation.62 This view did not represent a wholesale rejection of “morals”—
Saar employers were still accusing striking and Social Democratic workers
of being “immoral,” and Tille was attempting to de‹ne a new “morality”
of race—but its racial orientation did lay stress on the proper management
and cultivation of physical bodies.63
These concerns about productivity and racial ‹tness were also central
to changing employer attitudes toward company social provision in the
decade before 1914. In the Saar, where generous company welfare and its
moral bene‹ts were once celebrated by local industrialists like Stumm,
employers now routinely warned of the excesses of factory welfare and its
potential danger to productivity. As in the case of Sozialpolitik, they complained of the ways in which trade unions and social reformers had turned
the provision of company welfare into an employer’s “obligation.” Indeed,
after 1900, organized Catholic workers in the Saar showed much less gratitude for company “bene‹ts.” They came to regard factory welfare as a
negotiable condition of employment and thus subverted the function of
moral tutelage that formed the basis of such welfare schemes.64 As a result,
local employers claimed, the excessive provision of company welfare made
unavoidable the distribution of “unearned bene‹ts” to employees.65
Rather than reject state social policy and company welfare outright,
however, Saar employers advocated calculated measures of state and
employer intervention designed to ensure the proper operation of the
mechanisms of racial selection. This meant securing the “dynamic natural
meritocracy of mental and physical attributes” both in the household
economy, by subordinating women to men, and in the productive economy, by subordinating “the intellectually weaker to the intellectually
stronger, the physically weaker to the will of the physically stronger, and
the physically strong also to the will of the mentally strong.”66 Thus, if
large numbers of potentially useful workers manifest an “incapacity for
savings and ef‹ciency, an irresponsibility and thoughtlessness regarding

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

161

their health, bodily capacities, and capabilities,” the state should intervene
with more limited measures designed to promote self-help, thrift, and
physical health. In this way, state-sponsored and mandatory insurance
and sickness schemes would “sustain the labor power of wage earners
[Handkräfte] for a longer period of time” and would not be concerned with
the excess “comfort” and luxury of workers. In addition, labor protection
laws for women and old age and disability insurance schemes for injured
men would reduce the concern of the “working sex” (men) for the “workweary sex” (women) and thereby free women to provide better care for
children. They thus ensured the necessary means for the healthy development of the younger generation. All of these forms of intervention, according to Saar employers, should be geared toward generating “healthier and
‹tter” workers and optimal levels of economic productivity, which in turn
would contribute to the “health of the nation.”67
In addition, in 1908, Saar employers began to call explicitly for the
“reformulation of the function of factory welfare institutions” and to
reimagine company social policy as a means of fostering racial development. Rejecting the notion that the employer had any obligation to provide bene‹ts and welfare for workers, they now viewed company social
provision as part of the wage calculus—that is, it was rede‹ned as “compensation in return for superior performance”—and framed it within the
rhetoric of racial economy. Indeed, as early as 1903, the recognition that
the workplace was de‹ned by biological aptitude had led Saar employers
to insist that the modern industrial workforce was composed of an upper
stratum of “skilled industrial workers” and a lower stratum of unskilled
casual laborers (Handlanger). They went to great pains to identify this
“social aristocracy” of skill in the factory by means of surveys and quantitative measures: the “skilled” and “capable” industrial worker, a product
of modern technological-industrial change, was de‹ned on the basis of his
length of training (usually one or more years), wage level (twelve hundred
to sixteen hundred marks per year), full membership status in the company
Knappschaft, mental and physical qualities (e.g., “endurance, attentiveness, conscientiousness, dexterity, deftness, presence of mind, and consideration”), patterns of socialization, and alleged self-image as a disciplined
and proud worker.68 Accordingly, “special advantages,” including housing, loans, and subsidies, were now to be distributed to this “select group
of loyal, capable, and productive [leistungsfähig]” workers in order to promote the prospects of the most racially ‹t workers, to increase productivity
in the factory, and to complement the mechanism of natural selection.69

162

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Company Social Policy as Biopolitics
The new technocratic and racialized understandings of the relationship
between work, reproduction, and the Volkskörper were linked to a number
of institutional changes to the industrial workplace in Wilhelmine Germany. They were most clearly revealed in efforts to rationalize social provision in several of Germany’s major electrotechnical, chemical, and iron
and steel ‹rms after 1900. This involved the creation of special of‹ces and
agencies and the hiring or appointment of new “social secretaries” for the
administration of company bene‹ts and social programs, which were
often rearticulated in the languages of industrial and racial hygiene and
materialized in practices and institutions that marked out three new
domains of intervention: the biophysical capacities of the individual
worker, the reproductive health of the worker’s wife, and the physical
well-being of the newborn working-class child. In this context, employer
concerns began to (re)focus on the wives of industrial workers, their reproductive health, and their child-rearing practices.70 By contrast with the primarily moralizing ambitions of factory paternalism, especially in relation
to alleged moral bene‹ts to be derived from “proper” familial organization, these new biomedical practices and institutions were designed to prevent the “squandering of human labor power” (Menschenkräfte), by (at
least partially) reorganizing the conditions of industrial work and the procreative economy of the working-class family according to a wider biophysical calculus of labor productivity and racial “health.”71
This emergent biomedical regime of company social provision
emphasized the physical needs and functioning of the worker’s body. In
their programmatic social policy statement of 1906, of‹cials at the Röchling steelworks announced that the most important task of company welfare was now the maintenance of a “healthy and work-capable [arbeitsfähig] core of employees.”72 Toward that end, they and other Saar
employers began to institute a number of company programs and facilities
related to personal hygiene and medical care. Indeed, the internal architecture of the Saar factory was largely recon‹gured in the 1890s, as most
industrial ‹rms built a wide array of factory canteens, cafeterias, and special dispensaries for mineral water, coffee, tea, milk, and diluted beer;
medical facilities and, in some cases, fully equipped hospitals; and a number of special convalescent homes and “invalid workshops” for “in‹rm
and recuperating” workers. The Burbach steelworks and the Röchling
concerns, for example, both replaced their small, relatively ill-equipped

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

163

lazarettos with fully furnished, technologically advanced hospitals in
1896–97 and 1899, respectively. Indeed, the new hospital built by the Röchling concerns in Völklingen was soon expanded in 1908 and equipped with
a surgical station, an x-ray room, a section for physical therapy, medicinal
baths, massage rooms, and a sauna. These provisions were designed to
meet the “bodily needs” of the healthy workers, the sick and injured workers, and the aged and in‹rm “in need of care” and who found themselves
in a “condition of reduced labor power” (verminderten Kräftezustande)
and no longer considered themselves of “value.”73 In addition, existing
facilities were often upgraded and their functions reformulated in medical
terms. In 1903, the Burbach steelworks, for example, despite the existence
of two swimming pools, added a number of special bathing facilities—
Turkish, carbonic acid, electric, and other medicinal baths, whose purpose
was not only to cultivate good health but also to meet the “general needs
of cleanliness and personal hygiene.”74
The new biomedical calculus also suffused a wide range of other company educational or ideological initiatives. Of‹cials at the Röchling steelworks in Völklingen devised a number of leisure and educational activities
and institutions and recast existing ones for the purposes of sustaining the
health and physical economy of the worker. In 1906, they created a
“worker’s library,” equipped with “patriotic adult and youth reading
materials as well as popular scienti‹c books.”75 This was closely connected
to the activities of the new company-sponsored yellow unions (discussed in
greater detail in the next chapter), which entered into the realm of the
worker’s private life by means of pedagogical activities focused on the regulation of conduct in matters related to everyday behavior, economy, and
medicine. Led by Hermann Röchling, one of the leaders of the national
yellow union movement and Saar heavy industry after 1905, the Röchling
yellow union sponsored guest speakers who delivered lectures on “economic ef‹ciency” (Wirtschaftlichkeit), husbandry techniques for small animals, the dangers associated with the misuse of alcohol, and the everyday
behavior that would facilitate healthy lifestyles or “hygiene” (Gesundheitsp›ege).76 This was generally understood to promote the “capacity for
performance” (Leistungsfähigkeit) of the individual worker. In a language
that evoked the new technocratic calculus of ef‹ciency, Dr. Karl Röchling
made clear that the mission of the yellow unions was to disabuse workers
of the notion that wages should be based on “legal or moral considerations” and to convince them that wages should re›ect each worker’s willingness and “capacity for performance.”77 The yellow union therefore

164

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

became a critical site for the dissemination of the new biopolitical managerial rationality among their employees and larger efforts to disseminate
ideas about national ef‹ciency and the consolidation of the Volkskörper in
the increasingly global economic struggle between nation-races.
Nevertheless, the most extensive new forms of Saar company welfare
were designed to in›uence the procreative economy of the wage-earning
family and the activities of working-class women in particular. In accordance with the biomedical practice of social-racial hygiene, Saar employers insisted that the “far-sighted employer who thinks about the future of
his factory . . . must not only try to cultivate labor power [Handkräfte]; he
must also support the women and the children [of the laborer] in order to
cultivate the strength [Kraft] of the future generation.”78 They therefore
developed programs that were designed to keep workers’ wives at home,
such as food transport services that relieved women of the task of bringing
food to their husbands at the factory, as well as forms of social assistance
after 1900 that simultaneously de‹ned and targeted working-class women
as mothers of future workers. The most important new programs involved
medical care for pregnant women and assistance for women during the
period immediately after giving birth. Company of‹cials in Völklingen,
for example, established an advisory of‹ce for expectant and new mothers
(Mütterberatungsstelle) in 1907 and set up a specialized unit in the company hospital to provide immediate postnatal care for mothers. In addition, they created a program that offered in-home nursing and household
assistance to women who had recently given birth. Managed through the
local branch of the Patriotic Women’s Association, caregivers were sent by
the ‹rm to the homes of their employee-clients to provide “care for the
remaining children and the husband” and to maintain the household. The
overall aim of this activity was to prevent “lasting damage to the health”
of the mother from premature return to motherly duties, as well as to sustain the sexual division of labor in the household.79
Similarly, Saar ‹rms began offering a variety of child care programs
designed to improve the physical health of the “future generation.” Thus,
in 1904, the Burbach steelworks created a milk sterilization facility that
provided nontubercular milk to families with newborn children. In addition, a maternity home, a crèche, and an orphanage were established after
1906 to provide care for infants and children of former employees. Of‹cials
at the Röchling concerns organized recreation activities for children of
employees: their “summer break” (Sommerfrische) program involved an
entire regime of outings, physical exercise, and nutritional provision for

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

165

workers’ children. From May to September, children were taken by coach
out of the cramped and dirty industrial town of Völklingen and into the
surrounding countryside, where they could increase their “body weight”
and “regenerate themselves in the fresh forest air.” “Under the in›uence of
good forest air and [fresh] milk from summer to fall,” according to factory
physician Dr. Zillessen, “pale and suffering little mites are turned into
rosy-cheeked, strong children.”80
In addition to this emphasis on reproduction and child care, the new
company social policy targeted the household economy of the workingclass family and its sexual division of labor in a number of other ways.
After 1900, several company welfare schemes involving education were
devised—and others recon‹gured—to promote what employers deemed
to be ef‹cient, orderly, and hygienic living arrangements among their
employees’ families. Most large steel companies in the region organized
schools for small children (kindergartens) in the early years of industrial
expansion. Around the turn of the century, however, ‹rms began to create
factory schools (Werksschulen) and apprenticeship workshops
(Lehrlingswerkstätten) for the sons of industrial workers and sewing and
home economics schools for the daughters. Teenage boys were offered
instruction in a number of general skills, such as reading, grammar, simple
math, geometry, drawing, garden cultivation, and gymnastics, and in various technical skills, including metalworking, carpentry, plumbing, bookbinding, brush making, and animal breeding. Generally speaking, the purpose of this kind of practical “economic instruction” was to provide for
the “bodily development of young workers,” “to ensure that the labor
force will be appropriately trained, practically and theoretically, for its
future occupation,” and “to awaken in workers a sense for household
ef‹ciency, settledness, and thrifty living.”81
The forms of schooling and “continuing education” offered to daughters of factory workers were also increasingly framed within the rhetoric of
social hygiene. As early as the 1880s and 1890s, several Saar steel ‹rms had
created sewing and knitting schools for young girls, which were usually
run by the local women’s association (Frauenverein), headed by the wife of
the factory owner or director. After 1900, however, the emphases in female
education shifted to the development of home economics schools and the
desire to promote a more hygienic and “ef‹cient” working-class household economy.82 To cultivate girls into “capable wives,” the new housework schools at the Burbach steelworks, for example, offered courses in
sewing, knitting, laundry and housecleaning skills, child care and disci-

166

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

pline, cooking, and general housework. The 1906 test for a cooking class at
the Burbach home economics school involved developing a fourteen-day
plan to feed a family of four on a weekly budget of DM 11.54. The purpose
was to demonstrate that a “tired husband and hungry children did not
have to be fed only potatoes with coffee and bread” and that “a capable
worker’s wife could offer a variety of tasty meals with the aforementioned
means.” The teachers, of course, substituted several foods for meats,
including puddings, vegetables, and some ‹sh. Examinations at the end of
each term were designed to cover “all of the duties of housework, cleanliness, orderliness, the preparation of a variety of meals, economical budgeting, and the correct use of income.”83 This emphasis on both “economic
management” and “better nutritional maintenance” (Ernährung) was part
of a larger ambition of the girls’ schools to rationalize the gendered tasks
of the household economy and the physical maintenance of the wage-earning family.84
Perhaps most revealing were the guiding assumptions behind the distribution at the Röchling steelworks of everyday “items of necessity,” a
provision formerly understood primarily in terms of moral charity and
Christian obligation. According to company of‹cials, if the principal aim
of social policy was “to secure a health and work-capable core of laborers,” it was necessary to develop a broad range of initiatives that would
maintain the “good health of the population” and “above all . . . that of
the future generation as well.”85 Toward this end, workers and their families were provided with everyday items such as food, heating coal, and
clothing. Since many of the workers and their families were deemed incapable of attending to “matters of household economy,” however, company of‹cials and their assistants reviewed individual cases of need, dividing potential recipients into families of “inveterate drunks, idlers, etc.,” on
the one hand, and families who were hard pressed as a result of bad luck
and other factors beyond their control, on the other. The value of these
distinctions and “investigations of individual cases” was that they
“revealed valuable clues about how the evils and defects [Missstände]
could be remedied before they grew into dangerous diseases [Volkskrankheiten].”86
In this way, paternalist practice in heavy industry evolved into a new
kind of “social medicine” (soziales Heilmittel). Designed to cultivate both
a “greater willingness to serve” the company and healthy lifestyles among
workers, this biomedical orientation involved managing from a distance,
by means of the architectonic recon‹guration of factory space and the

The New Managerial Rationality and the Racialization of Industrial Work

167

redesign of welfare programs from coercive paternalistic interventions to
indirect biomedical and recreational services. It sought to regulate the
physical health of the individual laborer and the entire laboring family as
well as the working-class household economy in ways that would facilitate
“healthy” social relations. In this way, it established direct links between
the imperatives of factory production, the social and biological reproduction of the working-class family, and the racial health and ‹tness of the
larger Volkskörper. This turn to biomedical considerations and the logic of
bourgeois self-regulation partially displaced and recon‹gured the directly
coercive moralizing operation of company welfare schemes, along with
their purported “personal” relations and intimacies, as the latter were previously deployed and understood within the framework of paternalist
labor policy.

chapter 6

Corporatist Discourse and
Saar Heavy Industry

The new bioracial managerial rationality accompanied a wider transformation in the ideological discourse of employers and industrial culture. In
a departure from the familial metaphors and representations long associated with the paternalist factory regime, many Saar industrialists began to
reimagine work identities and social relations in distinctively corporatist
terms during the decade before 1914. In their industry newspaper, journal
publications, and internal reports after the turn of the century, they
became increasingly preoccupied with a new “social aristocracy” of labor
in the “productive economy” and a harmonious “community of work” in
the large industrial concern. They also began to link these de‹nitions of
work and occupational identity to a larger social imaginary that articulated a corporatist vision of a world composed of “occupational estates”
(Berufsstände). In this new ideological idiom, Saar employers began to call
for the political organization of a wider “occupational estate of industry
and trade” (Gewerbe- und Handelsstand ) and the formation of a corporative sociopolitical order. The prewar ideological discourse of Saar employers therefore became corporatist in a dual sense: it articulated a worldview
in a vocabulary that invoked forms of social address, natural hierarchy,
and community that seem reminiscent of the corporate order of the old
regime; and it formed the basis of programmatic political aims calling for
the direct representation of economic interests in the realm of party politics and the state.
Scholars have long understood this corporatist discourse in terms of
the persistence of premodern cultural and political traditions or antimod168

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

169

ern sociopolitical developments in German political economy during the
early twentieth century. Intellectual historians have traced corporatist
ideas about social order to a speci‹cally German tradition of romantic
“antimodernism” that rejected “modern, liberal, secular, and industrial
civilization” and helped pave the way for National Socialism.1 Social historians have attributed the appearance of a residual and “romantic” corporatist ideology to the right-wing Verbände, which helped to forge the
new economic and social interest groups of the Kaiserreich into a “secondary system of societal powers” that prevented the established political
parties from coordinating competing social interests, frustrated the establishment of democracy, and strengthened the “traditional antiparty orientation of the authoritarian state” during the late Kaiserreich.2 The practitioners of “social science history” formulated this interpretation explicitly
in relation to the Sonderweg thesis, which associated corporatist representations of social order and calls for the creation of a “corporative state”
(Ständestaat) with predominantly “preindustrial, precapitalist, and prebourgeois” social groups at odds with the political imperatives of modern
industrial capitalism.3
Historical sociologists of corporatism have focused not on archaic
ideologies and social relations in one nation but comparatively on the general structural realignments of advanced political economies during the
twentieth century. In this interpretive framework, the term corporatism
refers to a “new system of interest representation” common to the political
economies of the twentieth century, involving state-sanctioned and regulated bargaining between noncompetitive and hierarchically constituted
economic and social interest groups.4 It permits analysis of the ways in
which nearly all industrialized states in the twentieth century granted to
various organized interest groups a “representational monopoly” over
their speci‹c ‹elds of economic-social activity and displaced decisionmaking power away from the parliamentary arena toward the bureaucratized bargaining between state of‹cials and large-scale interest organizations. Despite its illuminating comparative framework, however, this
approach tends to portray right-wing corporatisms in places like “Fascist
Italy, Petainist France, National Socialist Germany and Austria under
Dollfuss” as state-centered projects derived from “delayed capitalist,
authoritarian,” and “neomercantalist” tendencies, rather as than
“advanced” capitalist systems and their exponents;5 and it rejects attempts
to understand corporatism in terms of historically evolved political-ideological relationships as opposed to a universal “axis of development” in

170

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

modern industrial societies.6 By contrast, this chapter draws attention to
the dynamics and productivity of discourse in the formation of social relations and the elaboration of capitalist political economies in order to offer
a new interpretation of the generative context and forward-looking, productivist meanings of corporatism as a variant of capitalist ideology in the
early twentieth-century Saar.

Corporatist Discourse in German Heavy Industry
Corporatist categories and assumptions shaped the theoretical re›ection
and social experience of a diverse range of philosophers, social theorists,
state of‹cials, and politicians in Germany and Europe during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In contrast to the new corporatist
theories about social order developed in France and Italy during the last
third of the nineteenth century or just before the First World War,7 German corporatist ideas appeared much earlier in the nineteenth century, in
the political philosophy of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Adam Müller, and
Hegel. In the period after 1830, Catholic social theorists—including Franz
von Baader, Bishop Ketteler, and Franz Hitze—embraced corporatist
ideas about social and political organization as a response to the problems
associated with industrial growth. In addition, estatist representations of
social order were integral to the midcentury social theory of Wilhelm
Heinrich Riehl, the traditionalist conservatism of Ernst von Gerlach in the
1860s and 1870s, the “monarchical socialism” of the prominent economist
Adolph Wagner, the Christian Socialism of Adolph Stöcker, and the corporative experiments of Bismarck, who in 1880–81 attempted to establish a
national economic council as a counterweight to the Reichstag.8 Indeed,
by the eve of 1914, corporatist terms and premises shaped the ideological
visions of a range of political and economic interest groups, including the
Conservative Party, the Agrarian League, and Mittelstand and peasant
organizations. Capable of accommodating a wide range of signifying practices and programmatic aims, corporatism proved to be a multiaccentual
discourse subject to different kinds of appropriation by a wide variety of
historical actors.
During the Wilhelmine period, perhaps the most important (re)articulation of corporatist discourse came in response to intensifying labor
con›ict in German politics, as an effort to dissolve the unifying appeals of
class. In the wake of the victories of the SPD in the Reichstag elections of

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

171

1903, the dramatic rise of trade unions and labor militancy, the formation
of nationwide employers’ antiunion organizations, and the growing “systematization of the weapons of struggle” at the workplace, in the form of
coordinated measures such as regionwide strikes, lockouts, blacklists, and
labor exchanges,9 the editors of various industry publications and spokesmen for heavy industry began calling as early as 1906 for new organizations capable of protecting the economic interests of the productive or
occupational “estates” (Berufsstände), as a response to the inroads made
by the “class-political” trade unions and the SPD into what were deemed
employer prerogatives at the workplace. After 1908, the growing popularity of corporatist vocabulary among industry publicists was unmistakable:
key ‹gures such as Hamburg factory owner J. A. Menck, Hamburg
banker Max M. Warburg, Krefeld Chamber of Commerce chairman Otto
Pieper, Düsseldorf Chamber of Commerce chairman Otto Brandt, and
Saar industry spokesman Tille began publishing articles and pamphlets
that explicitly referred to the imperative of occupational unity among German employers and elaborated plans for “occupational-political” (berufsstands-politische) organizations capable of representing employer interests.10 Indeed, such initiatives—articulated in corporatist visions of a
social order composed of “occupational estates”—increasingly came to
de‹ne the social policy orientation and political strategies of the CVDI
from 1908 to 1914.
The most systematic and tireless exponent of corporatist social theory
within the ranks of German heavy industry was Tille.11 In a series of essays
and books—most notably his four-volume study of German political
economy entitled The Occupational Politics of the Industrial and Commercial Estate (Die Berufsstandspolitik des Gewerbe- und Handelsstandes)—
Tille argued that modern industrial society was composed of three principal groupings or “occupational estates” (Berufsstände): the estate of
agricultural producers, the estate of educated professionals and of‹cials
(Beamtenstand ), and the estate of industrial and commercial producers
(Gewerbe- und Handelsstand ). These social groups, organized by strict
internal hierarchy, included everyone engaged in their respective areas of
economic activity (i.e., agriculture, intellectual labor, and industry and
commerce), from the wealthiest landowner, government of‹cial, and
employer down to the lowest paid farmhand, clerk, or wage laborer.
Indeed, Tille’s “estate of industry and trade” comprised producers from
twenty-one different branches of manufacturing and service industries,
including all factory owners, managers, white-collar clerks, and manual

172

laborers, along with all bankers, export manufacturers, merchants, retailers, independent artisans, and their employees.12
This was not, however, an atavistic representation of the social world,
continuous with preindustrial schemes of social classi‹cation. Most versions of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century corporatist vocabulary
in the German states articulated a vision of a legally and religiously sanctioned social order of four hereditary estates, comprising the nobility,
clergy, peasantry, and Bürgertum. According to this scheme, an individual’s place in society was determined by “birth, of‹cial sanction, or ecclesiastical ordination” and was relatively ‹xed.13 By contrast, Tille’s proposed estates were consequences of recent economic growth, ordered
along the lines of industry and occupation, and constantly evolving or
“dynamic-meritocratic” (dynameokratisch) social forms. In his words,
“the concept of estate had been transformed”; the former hereditary
estates had been “superseded” by the current occupational estates, and the
once “horizontal” arrangement of preindustrial estates (into upper, middle, and lower social layers) had given way to vertically aligned Berufsstände, each encompassing all levels of social status. Indeed, for Tille and
other industrialists, the feudal connotations of the word Stand had largely
given way by the Wilhelmine period to an entirely different understanding
of Berufsstand as an occupation.14
This ideological rearticulation of corporatist terms explicitly rejected
two other leading streams of corporatist discourse: Mittelstand protectionism and Catholic social theory. Tille rejected the corporatist social
imaginary of the guild-bound artisan and all political demands based on
the centrality of the small producer and the need to regulate and protect
trade through state intervention. He criticized the way in which these corporatist claims and identities produced internal divisions within the wider
“estate of industry and trade.” In particular, Tille dismissed as “Marxist
prejudices” the claims making their way “through broad sections of German Handwerk” that “economic activity that does not involve a certain
amount of manual exertion constitutes idleness rather than economic performance and that its results, which appear in the form of pro‹t and the
increasing value of productive capital, were tantamount to unearned,
immorally acquired, and illegitimate property.” These assertions, he maintained, converged with the class-political “slogans” of socialist workers
and failed to understand the central, generative force of “entrepreneurial
daring and the entrepreneurial spirit” in contemporary economic life.15
Similarly, the advocacy of Catholic social theorists in favor of a highly reg-

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

173

ulated and religiously grounded economic-social order of estates (StändeOrdnung), as a substitute for the current order of an expansive industrial
capitalism, was directly repudiated. Saar employers, under Tille’s editorial
direction, condemned such theories as grounded in an “ideal [based on]
the compulsory guild of the Middle Ages,” a violation of the freedom of
trade as dangerous as Catholic attempts to limit the “freedom of conscience [geistige Freiheit].” The “order of estates” as described in such
terms, they concluded, “is a ‹ctional literary idiocy” but also “a sign of the
fundamentally antagonistic stance that certain circles within Ultramontanism have taken against the liberal social order.”16
As this reference suggests, the changed meanings of the term estate
are particularly evident in the way Tille accommodated his corporatist
sociology to certain principles of economic liberalism. An ardent supporter of what he called the “liberal societal order,” in which the “freedom
of the individual” was secured, Tille took pains to defend the “freedom of
trade” and the “freedom of the wage contract,” by which he meant the
right of employers to set the terms of employment in their businesses without the involvement of the state, social reformers, or independent trade
unions.17 Tille staunchly defended the central features of the liberal economy, including private ownership of enterprise, private investment, and
capital accumulation, which became subjects of a regular column entitled
“The Liberal Societal Order” (Liberale Gesellschaftsordnung) in the pages
of the weekly newspaper of Saar heavy industry during this period. This
liberal framework, according to Tille, generated the conditions for a
“dynamic-meritocratic society” (dynameokratische Gesellschaft): it
released the creative capacities of the individual by offering “free room for
maneuver to all forces” and “granted each the right to display his abilities
. . . on the ‹eld of play.”18 In the realm of productive labor, Tille celebrated
the role of competition between individuals and individual “achievement”
or “performance” (Leistung) as the principal motor of industrial growth
and progress. Precisely this “dynamic” economic framework and the
industrial growth it fostered, he argued, had created the present social
order of productive estates.19
In addition, as the previous chapter would suggest, Tille’s corporatist
social analysis, like his theories about the industrial workplace, derived
from biological theories about human evolution and natural selection.
Accordingly, his vision of a “dynamic” society of occupational estates
rested on a social Darwinian paradigm that conceived of human relations
in terms of an ongoing “struggle for existence,” governed by the law of

174

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

natural selection. Social relations within the occupational estates, he
argued, were determined by the competition between biologically privileged or “capable” individuals, on the one hand, and those “less capable,”
on the other.20 Work, as we have seen, was central to this design, because
it was on the terrain of productive labor that individuals could realize their
different innate capacities and abilities. The hierarchy between employers
and workers in the world of production therefore re›ected the “natural,”
biological inequality among individuals. A factory owner, according to
Tille, simply possessed more evolved innate capacities, especially intellectual faculties, than a day laborer. Under these conditions, therefore, leading elements in the social order constituted a biologically determined
(male) “social aristocracy” of ability and achievement in the realm of work
and in the wider social grouping of the industrial and commercial
“estate.”21
In a way similar to his writings on the immediate domain of industrial
work, Tille also de‹ned the social aristocracy of work in the “productive
economy” of occupational estates in relation to contemporary concerns
and fears about the sexual division of labor and social and biological
reproduction of the “body of the nation” (Volkskörper). In his theory of a
social order of productive estates, as suggested in the previous chapter,
Tille counterposed the masculine realm of competition in the productive
economy with the male-headed (though largely female) household “savings economy,” in which the “natural meritocracy of mental and physical
attributes arranges itself . . . in a way that subordinates the woman to the
will of the man and the children to the will of both parents.” According to
this scheme, the appropriate interaction between the savings economy and
the productive economy would secure the biological reproduction of
future laborers and promote austere household ef‹ciencies that would
produce biologically “‹t” husband-fathers capable of competing in the
realm of productive labor.22 It provided the framework for a meritocratic
productive and biological order that would secure favorable conditions
for industrial growth and the health of the German Volkskörper. In this
way, the maintenance of the health and the cultivation of the innate capabilities of biologically superior male individuals, who comprised the new
“social aristocracy” of work in the social order of productive estates,
would allegedly improve the economic and biological prospects of the
German Volkskörper in the growing “struggle for existence” between
nation-races.23

175

Company Unions and the “Community of Work”
The vision of a social order composed of vertical strata of occupational
groupings also informed efforts to construct and symbolize new identities
for workers, the most sustained of which came with the formation of yellow, or company, unions (Werkvereine) in the Saar beginning in 1906. Like
employers in other German industrial regions after 1905, Saar factory
owners, managers, and “loyal” employees created company unions in
order to organize workers who would agree to reject strikes and membership in “strike organizations” (i.e., socialist, Christian, and liberal unions).
The ‹rst such organization, the Burbach Hüttenverein, was created in late
May 1906 at the Burbach steelworks in response to the organizational
efforts of the CMV at the plant.24 After the CMV launched its strike in
June and began to extend its recruitment efforts to other industrial towns,
of‹cials at other large factories began to follow suit: company unions were
subsequently created in 1907 at the Halberg steelworks in Brebach, the
Röchling steelworks in Völklingen, the Röchling coking plant in
Altenwald, the Vopelius glassworks in Sulzbach, and ‹nally, in 1912, the
Stumm steelworks in Neunkirchen. By means of coercive measures and
incentives—most notably by linking all company bene‹ts and social provision to membership in the union—Saar employers were very effective in
organizing their workers in the new antistrike unions. In 1912, for example,
the Burbach Hüttenverein numbered 4,671 members, 86.5 percent of the
total labor force of 5,400 workers. In addition, they created an impressive
regionwide movement by linking the unions together in the District
League of Saar Company Unions in March 1912, which immediately
became a corporate member of the national League of German Company
Unions (Bund deutscher Werkvereine).25
Most historians view the company unions, modeled after similar
organizations in the Ruhr and in Augsburg, as part of the long-standing
paternalist strategy for controlling labor, but in the Saar, this turn to company unionism occurred in the midst of the growing crisis of paternalist
hegemony and was linked to new efforts to rede‹ne relations between
employer and employee in the region after 1900.26 This crisis was manifested in the rise of organized labor and the emergence of what company
union organizer Dr. Karl Röchling called “class cleavages” at work—all
of which, he maintained, had rendered the paternalist vision of a familial
and “personal relationship between employer and employee” much less

176

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

convincing to a majority of Saar industrial workers.27 Saar factory owners
viewed the Werkvereine as a new organizational and ideological means by
which to counter socialist images of the exploited wage earner and the factory as an arena of class struggle. The principal aim of the company
unions was not simply to coerce the loyalty of workers or to seduce them
with “material advantages” but to win their active consent to relations of
inequality by offering them an alternative conception of the nature of
work relations in the modern factory. Referred to by of‹cials of the Röchling steelworks as the “inner conquest” of the labor force, this project was
framed by a newly emergent corporatist ideological formation, which
began to displace the paternalist model of work relations in favor of a new
mode of interpellation in which the worker was identi‹ed as an independently minded employee, family father, and national comrade who
rejected trade unions and sought to enter into a “peaceful” relationship
with his employer.28
Under the leadership of Hermann Röchling, son of the founding
director of the Röchling steelworks in Völklingen, and his social secretary
Karl Rupp, Saar company union leaders set out to forge a new “solidaristic unity of entrepreneurship, capital, and labor”—a “community of
work” (Arbeitsgemeinschaft or Werksgemeinschaft) in the factory or business enterprise.29 They drew on the research and theoretical writings of
Rostock economist Richard Ehrenberg, who, along with his student Erich
Sperler, helped to create the prototypical company unions at the Siemens
electrotechnical ‹rm in Berlin and the Krupp steelworks in Essen and to
train leaders of the Werkverein movement. The idea of a community of
work was based not on the paternalist vision of a factory family or on
preindustrial understandings of Gemeinschaft but, rather, on what its
advocates deemed “scienti‹c” and “empirical” observations of the nature
of work and industrial organization in the age of machine technology and
the large-scale factory. According to Ehrenberg, the increasingly complex
division of labor and the vast differences in skill, income, and status in the
“modern industrial enterprise” had given rise to a “community of work”
in which employers, managers, and workers shared the same interest—the
“business interest” (Geschäftsinteresse) of the ‹rm—rather than to an
arena of con›icting or competing interests. Yet the modern factory, unlike
previous forms of craft production, had evolved to meet a vast array of
local, regional, and global needs and therefore demanded far more complex organization (e.g., in terms of the division of labor and use of machine
technology) and central direction. Consequently, trade union demands for

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

177

codetermination and socialist demands for democratic control over the
economy had to give way to the authority of the employer, whose managerial skills or “intellectual labor” became the decisive motor of factory
production. Strict labor hierarchy, Ehrenberg maintained, became an existential imperative in the “community of work” of the modern factory.30
In contrast to the paternalist emphasis on the familial relations of the
factory family and the employer as “provider,” the rhetoric of Saar yellow
union leaders emphasized a new combination of associational, hierarchical, and competitive aspects of the work community in the factory.31 Local
employers like Hermann Röchling began to address their workers,
through the yellow unions, as “comrades” with shared interests, and the
company union movement as a whole embraced quasi-egalitarian selfde‹nitions and forms of address.32 In his speech before a meeting of the
Röchling yellow unions in August 1908, for example, the foreman Lober
stressed both the equality and hierarchy among employer and workers.
No matter what conditions we are born into, whether of high or
modest rank, we are all men and we are all workers. The worker who
gives us employment, however, especially deserves our highest
respect, owing to his education and knowledge. To him often fall the
dif‹cult tasks that command very intense efforts and a great deal of
knowledge. For this he earns our complete trust. We want to work
with him—work with him to try to improve the situation of each
individual.33
Company union leaders and functionaries therefore de‹ned the legitimacy
of their activities in distinctly populist terms, claiming that the new unions
derived their authority from the support and desires of their wage-earning
members rather than from the paternalist benevolence of the employer or
the state. Röchling machinist Latz said, “We need no government saviors,
like state secretaries or Obergenossen, to bring us good fortune.” Indeed,
company welfare schemes were vigorously redescribed: no longer deemed
the product of employer charity (i.e., “alms” or “beggar’s money”), they
were regarded by the individual Werkvereinler as the legitimate “fruits of
his labor,” the just rewards for superior job performance. Indeed, the company unions sought to encourage this self-interested understanding of
work and performance by means of combating the “leveling” tendencies
of the trade unions—especially any attempt to establish a minimum wage
catering to the “lazy”—and enforcing wage incentive structures that

178

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

rewarded only the “diligent” and talented.34 According to this self-image,
company union members were deemed independently minded architects
of their own fate, who had consciously decided to subordinate themselves
to their employers. The company union leader Nikolaus Zimmer
expressed this notion of “independence” with admirable succinctness:
“We have our freedom just like the [other] trade unionists and we do what
we think is right. If we cultivate a peaceful relationship to the ‹rm in the
yellow unions, then we are doing this out of the conviction that it is the
best for us.”35
Saar Werkvereine also developed organizational structures and activities that were designed to accommodate the everyday “living conditions”
(Lebensverhältnisse) of their members and to cultivate the masculine and
nationalist-racist ethos of the factory community—a new mode of interpellation that displaced the parent-child metaphors of paternalist discourse and recast workers as family fathers and national comrades. Most
created administrative bodies and representative procedures characteristic
of the voluntary association, including a governing council, a directorate
comprising representatives from different factory sections, a general
assembly of all members, and “courts” for settling disputes.36 Beyond the
formal meetings and administrative tasks, moreover, lay a much wider
‹eld of sociability that served to “cultivate a good comradery” and the
“spirit of unity” among all employees and employers of a ‹rm.37 The yellow unions sponsored a broad range of educational and athletic activities,
including libraries, lectures, musical and theatrical groups, sports clubs,
and youth sections, as well as numerous social events (e.g., festivities and
family outings), which were designed to provide for the leisure needs of
workers and their families. According to Dr. Karl Röchling, these offerings and the general hostility toward trade unions best served the interests
of the workers and their families.38 In this context, the company unions
de‹ned workers as both independent employees and family fathers, who
were now responsible for their own “dependents.” In addition, the Saar
company unions attempted to nourish the “feeling of brotherly community” among their members and to forge “comradely” bonds with other
male industrial workers within the dense local network of nationalist associations. These ranged from choral societies and gymnastics clubs to the
organizations more directly committed to propagandizing on behalf of
German nationalism, Weltpolitik, and antisocialism.39 Placing the Saar
organizations squarely within the milieu of nationalist pressure groups on
the German right during the prewar decade were their direct links with the

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

179

local National Liberal party, the only viable “nationally minded” party in
the region after 1900; their membership in the League of German Company Unions, of which Karl Rupp was the managing director; and their
membership in the Council of National Workers’ and Occupational
Leagues of Germany (Hauptauschuss nationaler Arbeiter- und Berufsverbände Deutschlands), which included as members Hermann Röchling, Dr.
Karl Röchling, and Rupp.40 Finally, this national orientation was articulated to the new biomedical emphasis on physical health, social hygiene,
ef‹ciency, and “performance”—the incipient racialization of managerial
rationalities—discussed in the previous chapter. Thus the Saar yellow
unions, which offered lectures and reading materials to its members,
became important sites for the elaboration and dissemination of the new
biopolitical managerial rationality and for larger efforts to cultivate
national ef‹ciency and the consolidation of the “national body” (Volkskörper) in the increasingly global economic struggle between nationraces.
Finally, Saar employers, under Tille’s direction, linked the community of work in the factory with efforts to build a larger “occupationalestate consciousness.” Accordingly, the company union was deemed the
best means of cultivating among workers the attitudes and values that
would foster a “feeling of occupational community within the entire estate
of industry and trade.”41 Employers viewed the yellow union as the ideal
form of occupational association (Berufsverein), since it schooled its members in the laws of (corporatist) political economy and “economic peace.”
In the course of its meetings, educational lectures, and classes, the company union provided the necessary technical training for speci‹c occupations in the factory, a “certain technical understanding for the enterprise
and its operations,” and a more general and scienti‹c “economic knowledge” of the natural functioning and requirements of the industrial economy. Indeed, Tille himself was actively involved in organizing and delivering lectures on “economic and social questions” to the company unions.42
Moreover, the Saar company unions incorporated ongoing efforts, discussed in the previous chapter, to identify the “skilled aristocracy of
labor” in relation to an emergent “occupational consciousness” and more
recent efforts to introduce new factory uniforms for long-standing
employees at the Burbach and Röchling steelworks and the Fenne glassworks in 1905.43 The new uniforms were modeled after the miners’ uniforms, which consisted of the familiar black tunic, factory cap with plume,
and leather apron, and were meant to invoke the corporatist traditions of

180

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

the mining industry. At the Burbach steelworks, they accompanied the
introduction of a new “factory festival,” which also took the defunct
“mining festival” as its model, and became the most visible symbolic representations of the elevated “corporatist” identity of the allegedly nonproletarianized company union man. “When the laborer wears his work
smock with pride,” Saar employers claimed, “he clings to his occupation
and job with a different kind of passion than he would were he only a
member of an undifferentiated multitude.”44 In this way, employers in the
steel and glass industries hoped that the new uniforms would integrate the
company unionist symbolically into the masculine, disciplined, and even
martial formations of uniformed foundry men, whose physical strength,
dexterity, discipline, and obedience to workplace superiors differentiated
them from the (feminine) “‘starving battalions,’ with which Socialism
parades.”45 In view of the strike threat and class con›ict posed by socialist
and Christian unions, these activities were deemed crucial to the ideological labor of imprinting “in the mind of every reasonably talented company union member a mental picture of the world of the economy as it
really is today,” easily grasped in a “conceptual system” and “slogans”
(Stichworte) that would effectively counter the dangerous economic theory
and “thieves’ argot” of socialism.46 “Much more modern” than the “classpolitical” trade unions, the company unions were designed to convince
each individual member of the need to master the masculine skills necessary for superior job performance and for overcoming the “risks of life”—
risks that were conditioned by “his health, his labor power, and his capabilities” and by the workings of a global industrial economy driven by
large-scale factory production, productive occupations (Berufsstände),
and the laws of racial-biological competition.47

The Organization of Labor Con›ict, the Public Sphere, and the
Corporatist Realignment of Industrial Interests
The previously discussed responses to labor organization and the increasing militancy of socialist (and, to a much lesser extent, Christian) trade
unions were related to new efforts to establish nationwide antistrike coalitions among German employers and comprehensive attempts to organize
all sectors of German capital into political pressure groups during the
decade before the First World War. They were thus part of the more general corporatist realignment of German and European political economy

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

181

after the 1890s. In Germany, this structural transition was propelled by the
growing con›ict between organized labor and capital after 1900. It
emerged especially from efforts to forge an “employers’ movement,” initially as part of a response to the labor con›ict in Crimmitschau in 1903–4,
but also in relation to what industrialists perceived to be the privileging of
organized labor and workers’ interests in the main political parties, the
Reichstag, the agencies of the imperial German state, and the “public
sphere.” These efforts at consolidation changed the scope and style of
employer politics in Wilhelmine Germany, including the size and breadth
of employer organizations and coalitions, the intended targets and audiences of their appeals, the kinds of functionary or “organic intellectual”
directing their actions, and the ideological claims and discourses informing their strategies.
Locally, these changes were prompted by the determined efforts of
Social Democrats and Christian trade unionists to break into the region
after 1903, but the national impetus behind the formation of new industrial
organizations and alliances among existing Verbände was the bitter textile
strike in Crimmitschau from August 1903 to January 1904. In the midst of
this strike, which was supported by the Social Democratic free trade
unions, CVDI leaders collected funds in support of the Crimmitschau textile manufacturers. They then voted to create the Central Of‹ce of
Employers’ Associations in January 1904 and elected a committee led by
Saar industrialist Richard Vopelius to draw up statutes for a new antistrike organization of German industry. On January 17, representatives
from nearly all sectors of German industry met in Berlin to discuss the initiative, and negotiations took place between the leaders of domestic heavy
industry in the CVDI and leaders of export-oriented and light and ‹nishing industries of the League of German Industrialists (Bund der Industriellen, hereafter BdI). The CVDI-led initiative resulted in the formation
in April 1904 of the Main Of‹ce of German Employers’ Associations
(Hauptstelle Deutscher Arbeitgeberverbände, hereafter HDA), which
included representatives and organizations from the large-scale coal and
steel, textile, paper, and glass industries. Despite efforts to forge a broad
antiunion coalition, however, leaders of the BdI called for the formation
of their own antistrike organization, subsequently named the Association
of German Employers’ Organizations (Verein Deutscher Arbeitgeberverbände, hereafter VDA), which was of‹cially created in June 1904. The
leaders of the VDA, which included industrialists and employer organizations from medium-size and smaller ‹rms especially from the metal and

182

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

construction trades, agreed with the antistrike ambitions of the HDA but
were opposed to a leadership role of the CVDI and favored different kinds
of antiunion strategies appropriate to the size of their ‹rms and their different labor conditions.48
In the Saar, efforts to forge a broad antistrike organization for large
and small industries were far more successful. In mid-May 1904, the leaders of all three industrial organizations voted to create a new regional antistrike association, the Employers’ League of Saar Industry (Arbeitgeberverband der Saarindustrie, hereafter AVSI), which would collect funds
in support of its members in the case of a strike and would support
employers throughout Germany by means of its corporate membership in
the HDA. Initially, its members were primarily from local private heavy
industry, though until 1905, its initiatives were also supported by the Mining Of‹ce in Saarbrücken. In addition, Tille, as general secretary of the
Saar organizations, actively sought to build a wider coalition with employers in smaller industries of the region, especially those ‹rms—primarily in
the brewing, construction, tailoring, bakery, and shoemaking trades—
which were more susceptible to union demands and even had to tolerate
socialist unionists among their employees. A spring boycott of the Aktien
Brewery of St. Johann-Saarbrücken and a strike by local masons shortly
thereafter prompted employers in the brewery and construction industries
to seek new antistrike alliances across the region. In early March, the
brewery owners of the Saar, Trier, and the Palatinate met with Louis
Vopelius and Tille (who gave a talk about the national importance of these
efforts) to create a new organization. After Tille wrote the statutes, the
Employers’ League of the Breweries of Southwest Prussia, the Palatinate,
and Neighboring Regions (Arbeitgeberverband der Brauereien Südwestpreussens, der Pfalz und benachbarter Gebiete) was of‹cially called into
being on 27 April. Similarly, in mid-July, some sixty master artisans from
the construction trades met in St. Johann to discuss the formation of an
antistrike organization. In conjunction with Tille and the Saar Chamber of
Commerce, they created the new Employers’ League for the Construction
and Associated Trades of the Saar Region (Arbeitgeberverband für das
Baugwerbe und die verwandten Berufe der Saargegend, hereafter
AVBS).49
Despite the split between the HDA and the VDA and the continuing
tensions and differences between big domestic capital, on the one hand,
and export-oriented and small capital, on the other, these efforts at coalition building signaled the beginning of a new era of employer politics dur-

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

183

ing the prewar decade—a process crowned in any case by the “fusion” of
the HDA and the VDA in the Alliance of German Employers’ Leagues in
April 1913.50 This was evident in the organizational and ideological
changes that transformed several of the leading industrial interest groups
and their activities. First, German employers dramatically expanded the
breadth and scale of their organizations during this period: the number of
industrial interest organizations increased from 366 in 1900 to 3,670 in
1914; the latter included 3,040 local, 509 regional or district, and 121
national associations, though historians estimate that as many as four
hundred or ‹ve hundred of all of these associations were active on the
national level. Accordingly, the level of organization in a number of largescale industries—namely, the extractive (49.7 percent), textile (50.5 percent), and metalworking (43.2 percent) industries—and the numbers of
workers in their employ far outpaced the organizing capacities of the trade
unions.51 Second, this drive toward nationwide employer organization
enabled new efforts to devise more effective antiunion measures, including
more comprehensive blacklisting arrangements, lockouts, employers’
labor exchanges, strike funds and insurance schemes, and the yellow
unions. Third, industrial and other economic associations were transformed organizationally into more effective public pressure groups in
ways that allowed new departures from previous lobbying practices. This
involved the expansion of the central of‹ces of new and existing Verbände,
in terms of the size of their clerical staffs and the preeminence of a new
“type of association politician” or “functionary” who took over the business of running the employers’ organizations from the older-style practitioner.52 Across most sectors of industry, this signaled the rise of a new
kind of organic intellectual, whose primary responsibilities were to direct
the organization and its ideological initiatives rather than to oversee or
manage a particular factory or business. The Saar case is perhaps most
illustrative in this regard: the former literature professor Tille, who built
an entire public relations apparatus in the Saar after 1903, became the
leading representative of heavy industry, replacing the factory owner
Stumm, a parliamentary politician and self-described man of practice,
who died in 1901.
The new centrality of the Verband functionary derived from employers’ efforts to reorient their political activities more consistently toward a
new audience and political domain, the “masses” as ideologically transformed into the public sphere (Öffentlichkeit) in the years after 1900. This
important shift in strategies of interest articulation and representation

184

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

both supplemented and departed from a long-standing practice of cultivating personal connections with leading ministers and government
of‹cials as well as delegates of the bourgeois parties. As in the Saar, the
growing size and militancy of the trade unions across Germany and the
electoral successes of the SPD—particularly the Crimmitschau con›ict
and the Ruhr miners’ strikes of 1905—were in part enabled by and conducted on the terrain of Öffentlichkeit. German industrialists and their
representatives recognized this fundamental transformation of public culture and sought to engage its discursive modalities and institutional forms.
This explains the comments (cited in the introduction) of Eugen Leidig,
deputy director of the CVDI, in the fall of 1905, about the two most important and thus new weapons of workers: the “universal and equal franchise” and “public opinion and the press,” which, “with their silent and
pressing authority . . . force all of our political parties to engage in the
struggle for workers’ votes.”53 It also indicates the seriousness of complaints by ‹gures like Emil Kirdorf, Ruhr industrialist and member of the
CVDI directorate, who acknowledged similar pressures and the de‹cits of
heavy industry’s existing channels of interest articulation, in his re›ections
on the role of the press just after the Ruhr miners’ strike of 1905: “Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that we have not paid enough
attention to the press and have underestimated its signi‹cant effects on the
great masses (i.e., public opinion), parliament, and government.”54
CVDI general secretary Bueck, who routinely invoked the factor of
Öffentlichkeit in setting the terms and conditions of industrial relations
and economic activity during CVDI and VDESI meetings after 1905, conceived of the HDA precisely in terms of its role in developing a “thoroughly active presence in the press” in order to in›uence public opinion.
Despite the halting progress and mixed results of the CVDI’s attempts to
develop new strategies of publicity, its emphasis on “public relations” after
1900 was unmistakable and culminated in the massive press apparatus
assembled by Krupp chairman and industry publicist Alfred Hugenberg
after 1912.55 But Gustav Stresemann and other leaders of the BdI, recognizing public opinion as a “power” but also as “driftwood” that was carried “here and there by various tendencies,” sought most systematically to
redirect its amorphous trajectories by means of “enlightenment”—“to
win” public opinion over to the “justi‹ed interests of industry.” “We must
accept conditions the way they are,” they maintained, “and say to ourselves: We live in the age of the in›uence of the masses, therefore industry
must also rally the masses to it and attempt to exert in›uence through the

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

185

masses on public opinion and legislation and on political parties.” The latter adjusted their policies in relation to the “masses.”56 The central purpose of the BdI, according to its statutes, was to represent “the interests of
German industry in relation to the claims of other branches of commerce
and in relation to governments, parliaments, and the public sphere.”57
Like the Saar mining of‹cials discussed in chapter 4, representatives of all
branches of German industry increasingly acknowledged that the principal function of their organizational activity would be to in›uence public
opinion in the public sphere in their battle against the trade unions, social
democracy, social reform, and state Sozialpolitik.
This orientation toward Öffentlichkeit entailed efforts to establish
new press organs as media of direct economic interest articulation in the
formal political domain—a distinctively corporatist realignment of
employer lobbying practices that meant abandoning the sole reliance on
“political” or “neutral” newspapers under nominally independent ownership and editorial direction (including the Kölnische Zeitung, the
Rheinisch-Westfälische Zeitung, and Die Post) to voice their demands.
Leaders of the CVDI, which already published its own newsletter, were
not very successful in this regard. By the end of 1900, they had secured control over the Berliner Neueste Nachrichten, which was to represent “the
social policy and trading interests of German industry” within the framework of national interests and the “basic principles bequeathed by the
founder of the Reich.”58 But criticism from the press, which focused on its
direct links to heavy industry, led to the failure of this experiment by 1904
and a consequent reluctance directly to purchase another newspaper. As a
result, CVDI leaders came to prefer strategies designed to secure their
in›uence over existing newspapers via subventions and advertising. Nevertheless, other industrialists and their spokesmen, many of them members
of the CVDI, were far more innovative. In addition to Stresemann, the
most important early example of this reorientation came from J. A.
Menck, who was president of the Altona Chamber of Commerce, a leading ‹gure in the National League of German Metal Industrialists, and
cochairman of the VDA. Menck was one of the most active of the new
brand of industrial functionary and publicist; he was the leading force,
along with editor Willy Reiswitz, in the establishment of the Deutsche
Arbeitgeber-Zeitung, the ‹rst successful newspaper designed to represent
the interests of German employers in the public sphere.59
In the Saar, where this turn to direct publicity occurred under Tille’s
direction, the corporatist political logic of these efforts was rendered

186

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

explicit. While local industrialists renamed the industry newspaper Neues
Saarbrücker Gewebeblatt as the weekly supplement to the Neue Saarbrücker Zeitung (hereafter NSZ) in 1896, only in the years after 1903 did
the main press organ of Saar heavy industry evolve into an independent
newspaper. This began with an editorial redesign under the name
Saarindustrie und Handel in the summer of 1903. But since the latter
remained under the control of the NSZ’s publishers, who were said to be
“not able to treat the different interests that are represented in the papers
that they publish equally” and to “consider the interests of private heavy
industry last,” local employers, along with Tille, established Saarindustrie
und Handel as an “independent weekly” ‹nanced by the Saar Chamber of
Commerce, the SGVDESI, and the VWGWISI toward the end of 1903.60
This change, according to its editors, was part of a national trend involving the emergence of an “independent representation of interests” from
within the ranks of German industry. In its ‹nal prewar format, introduced during the summer of 1906 and underwritten by all of the leading
Saar business organizations, the Südwestdeutsche Wirtschaftszeitung
(hereafter SWDWZ) was explicitly designed to redress the perceived failures of existing newspapers to represent the “pure” economic interests,
unadulterated by moral and political considerations, of German industry
and to describe their underlying “objective” origins.
In the daily press . . . , whether it is representing the opinion of a political party or is completely neutral [farblos], the tone of economic
interests in its complete purity only rarely appears. To be sure, there
are also more objective and less objective papers, papers that print a
certain range of perspectives, and papers that agree with a single
party line, in the selection of their topics and in their general orientation [Tendenzdarstellung]. But an objective economic consideration of
economic matters is offered only in the business sections of our major
newspapers, which, however, almost daily produce the strangest contradictions with the opinions expressed in the political sections.
Moreover, these business sections limit themselves almost exclusively
to the reproduction of actual business news and overviews of the market situation. Insight into the causes of these conditions is only rarely
attempted. Recently, the range of economic reporting in numerous
daily newspapers has been considerably diminished by the fact that
they have included moralizing considerations, alongside party-political views, instead of giving space to economic perspectives. For the

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

187

most part, the former have a socialist tendency; after all, they seek
mainly to agitate for the most equality possible [Gleichmacherei].
In order to combat the mainstream daily press, “sickened” as it was by a
pervasive “social moralism,” a belief in “equality,” and a “one-sided concern with the interests of workers,” the SWDWZ would represent the economic interests of southwest Germany and the putatively shared “interests
and views” of all employers (Unternehmertum).61
This new orientation entailed an emphasis on the ideological production of corporatist economic interests and social identities in the activities
of employers’ associations. Not only were employers and their representatives increasingly concerned to (re)de‹ne the meanings of work, the
worker, labor relations, and the functions of the modern business enterprise; they were now engaged in efforts to de‹ne the factory owner or
employer (as “productive employer” [gewerblicher Unternehmer]), his
interests, and his corporate relations to other social groups in the wider
social order. This involved deploying the new de‹nitions of the speci‹c
qualities and interests of the productive employer (understood as a unitary
identity) in coalition-building initiatives within and between various sectors of German manufacturing and trade. Two of the most innovative centers of this kind of activity were Hamburg-Altona and the Saar, where
industry representatives went about self-consciously forging wider unities
among the disparate sectors of small and big capital. Menck and Reiswitz
were the ‹rst industrial leaders and representatives to create a comprehensive employers’ organization, the Employers’ League of Hamburg-Altona,
which included representatives from heavy to light industry as a matter of
design and, in the pages of the Deutsche Arbeitgeber-Zeitung, attempted to
rally employers to their own collective defense against the trade unions by
means of the “cultivation of an esprit de corps” and the “consolidation” of
their shared “consciousness of estate” (Standesbewusstsein).62 It was precisely this model that they advocated and developed in the subsequent formation of the VDA.63
In a similar vein, Tille viewed the increasing coordination of employer
efforts in the wake of the Crimmitschau strike—signaled locally by the creation of AVSI—as the beginning of an occupational-political “employers’
movement,” unifying a broad array of local, regional, and national coalitions among German employers into a formation of industrial-commercial concentration. Tille maintained that this was “a movement among
much wider circles of productive employers . . . that goes well beyond cir-

188

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

cles of industrialists and therefore is better suited than just any industrialists’ movement to form the basis of a political movement, even though it
does not yet encompass trade and commerce.”64 Much like the Menck and
Reiswitz initiatives in Hamburg-Altona, Tille’s efforts to build contacts
between a wide range of employers in the Saar and southwest Germany—
through the chambers of commerce, the Berufsgenossenschaft, the brewers’ and builders’ associations, and the AVSI—were informed by the
imperative to cultivate a shared “consciousness of estate” (Standesbewusstsein) among all “productive employers.”65

Saar Employers, Berufsstandspolitik, and Corporative
Sociopolitical Order
The ideological production of corporatist social identities and visions of
corporatist political order were critical to the efforts to forge organizational links among employer organizations in response to what Saar
employers perceived to be threats to their autonomy at the workplace and
to their decision-making powers more generally—responses that brought
about a striking ideological reorientation of employer politics in relation
to state social policy, sympathetic political parties (especially the National
Liberal Party), and the political-constitutional order of Germany itself. By
contrast with their support for Bismarckian Sozialpolitik in the 1870s and
1880s, Saar and German industrialists associated with the CVDI now criticized the increasing volume of state welfare commitments, pursued by
Secretary of Interior Posadowsky in particular: the expansion and restructuring of the invalidity programs in 1899, the expansion of sickness insurance in 1903, and the introduction of pensions for widows and orphans in
1911; new workplace safety measures and further restrictions on work time;
the introduction of mandatory works councils in Prussian mining in 1905;
and the government bill calling for worker chambers (Arbeitskammer) that
was ‹rst mooted in 1905 and introduced in the Reichstag in 1908.66 As
chapter 4 suggested, the growing presence of trade unionists and Social
Democrats in the governing bodies of the social insurance schemes proved
particularly decisive in reshaping the attitudes of German industrialists.
Accordingly, they began to locate the cause of these developments variously in the imperial government’s reluctance to crack down on social
democracy and the unions, the failure of the existing parties to defend
employer prerogatives, and the universal male suffrage of the Reichstag,

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

189

which allowed the SPD and Center to formulate labor and welfare policy.
In short, employers began to criticize the entire party-political and constitutional system of imperial Germany, which they believed had subverted
the vital interests of heavy industry.
In the Saar, employers decried these changes as threats not just to the
racial order of the industrial economy but also to the “existential interests”
of the “industrial and commercial estate.” The accumulation of ‹nancial
and regulatory burdens and the failure to curb the “extortion” of the trade
unions, local employers maintained, had reduced “productive employers”
(gewerbliche Unternehmer) to “citizens with lesser rights.” According to
this critique, German employers had increasingly become victims of trade
union and “social-moralist” excess, of “ideologically construed claims for
rights” that failed to comprehend the actual “forces” that sustained “economic and social life” in Germany. The “social-moralists” (i.e., social
reformers, union leaders, and Social Democrats) ignored the central position of the employer as the superior “social aristocrat,” the “bearer of the
productive economy,” who provided work, promoted technological innovation, and mastered the challenges of competition in the expanding
industrial order—namely, harnessing the available “economic forces, productive forces, intellectual power, and labor power.” The unbounded
claims of “social moralists” therefore allegedly threatened the most important branch of German economic life—the “productive” workshops, factories, and businesses of the “industrial and commercial estate”—and the
competitive prospects of German manufacturing in the international
economy.67
These concerns fueled criticism not just of the dominance of the parties of reform (the SPD, the Center, and the left liberals) in the Reichstag,
but also of the National Liberal Party, long an important bastion of industrial interests. In the years after 1900, as chapter 4 demonstrated, the left
wing of the National Liberal Party, including its Young Liberal sections,
began to push for a program of social reform and progressive taxation,
forcing party chairman Ernst Bassermann to pursue strategies capable of
keeping both left and right wings together. As early as December 1907,
Axel Bueck, general secretary of the CVDI, had advised members of the
VDESI to reexamine heavy industry’s relationship to the National Liberal
Party. Two months later, he warned of the leftward drift noticeable in the
“social policy of the National Liberal Reichstag fraction that in many
ways contradicted the interests of industry and employers.”68 At the same
time, leading industry periodicals such as the Deutsche Arbeitgeber-

190

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

Zeitung were increasingly complaining about “insuf‹cient representation”
of industrial interests and about election to the Reichstag of party delegates “whose understanding of political economy amounted to nothing.”69
In the Saar, the reorientation of the National Liberal Party, especially
its embrace of the social policy and electoral strategy of its left wing and
the latter’s support for the striking steelworkers in Malstatt-Burbach in
the summer of 1906, also generated growing dissatisfaction among local
industrialists. Indeed, from 1908 to 1914, leading representatives of Saar
heavy industry either abandoned the National Liberal Party or reexamined their commitments to it in light of continuing ideological af‹liations
and tactical electoral imperatives. Not surprisingly, the Free Conservative
Tille, who was mistakenly ousted from the National Liberal Party for his
remarks during the Burbach steel strike, organized much of this dissent.70
In June 1908, he accused the National Liberals of abandoning their earlier
support for the “ideals of political freedom” and the central tenets of Germany’s “liberal social order”—that is, “freedom of trade,” the “free wage
contract,” and the right of employers to set all the terms and conditions of
work in business enterprises—and of supporting excessive social welfare
and reform initiatives in their efforts to court “the masses during the
Reichstag elections with promises of attaining heaven on earth for their
voters.” Speaking before a combined general meeting of the main Saar
business organizations, Tille declared that the liberal parties were “so
strongly infused with egalitarian ideas, indeed even communistic tendencies, that they have left the former ideals of political freedom in the background.” The National Liberal Party’s descent into the arena of social
reform, he claimed, was simply part of a strategy to curry favor with the
masses: “Out of National Liberalism has grown a National ‘Equalism,’ a
National Socialism that will obviously transform one day into a National
Communism.”71 In a formal statement, the executive committees of the
SGVDESI, the VWGWISI, and the AVSI con‹rmed this perspective on
the “privileging of the workers’ estate” and their growing opposition to the
National Liberal Party.
A decade ago one could still call the majority of German industry
National Liberal; today that is no longer the case. Since the National
Liberal Party has embarked on a socialistic and egalitarian course in
competition with the Center and social democracy over the support
of the masses, industry has moved considerably further toward the
political right. . . . The overwhelming majority of industry today
refuses any connection to the National Liberal Party.72

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

191

This criticism continued in the employer press and found varying degrees
of support among most of the leading National Liberal employers and
their representatives in the Saar, including Weisdorff, Theodor Müller
(director of the Stumm steelworks), Louis and Hermann Röchling, and
Louis Vopelius.73 Weisdorff, along with the National Liberal electoral
association of his own district of Malstatt-Burbach, even broke temporarily with the local party organization in the spring of 1908, when the party
supported the candidacy of the reformist Dr. Maurer for the upcoming
Landtag election.74
In the years after 1908, these concerns about the National Liberal
Party, coupled with the declining numbers of employers serving as delegates in the Reichstag, prompted a series of nationwide discussions about
the political organization of employers. In the spring of that year, the
Hamburg manufacturer Menck offered, in the pages of the Deutsche
Arbeitgeber-Zeitung, the ‹rst widely discussed plan for a more effective
employers’ organization, a proposed “league of productive employers”—
comprising all industrialists, artisans, and small shopkeepers—that could
provide the lobbying strength employers needed to curb the social legislation of the Reichstag. Subsequent proposals for an employers’ party, electoral organizations, and direct ‹nancing of campaigns were aired by
numerous other representatives of heavy industry.75 In addition, Tille
called for the formation of a “league of employers” that would include
producers in all branches of heavy and light industry, as well as large- and
small-scale commercial, retail, and artisanal trades. Such an organization
was needed, he maintained, in order to overcome the “divisive sectarian
dispositions” among German producers—that is, to create the conditions
in which “no one any longer thinks of himself as a member of a particular
branch [of industry] but rather . . . as a comrade within an occupational
estate.” Rather than focus only on Sozialpolitik and limit itself to in›uencing the existing parties (like most of the other proposals), Tille’s league was
conceived most explicitly as a corporatist (berufsstandspolitische) organization that would replace the “obsolete” parties and represent employer
interests directly in the organs of the state.76
Plans for a political organization of employers were ‹nally realized
with the creation of the Hansabund (Hansa League) in the summer of
1909. According to many German historians, the Hansabund marked the
‹rst comprehensive antiagrarian coalition of German capital before 1914
and thus embodied liberal aspirations for a politically active bourgeoisie
ready to protect “commerce, trade and industry against attacks” from a
“one-sided agrarian demagoguery” and to challenge the “feudal” power

192

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

holders of the German state.77 Yet many industrialists associated with the
CVDI were also interested in the Hansabund. As several historians have
pointed out, they regarded their participation in the new organization as
necessary for tactical reasons—as a means of maintaining or resecuring
the priorities of domestic heavy industry among economic pressure groups
as well as their in›uence over this important new initiative in the “employers’ movement.”78 But many leading German industrialists were also interested in the Hansabund as a corporatist form of interest representation.
They conceived of it as the commercial-industrial version of the Agrarian
League—that is, as an association that would represent the concerns of
German industry during elections, in the parties, and at all levels of parliamentary government.79
In the Saar, this corporatist ambition was central to the self-understanding of the Hansabund’s local branch. The initial July announcement
for the founding meeting called on local businessmen to respond to the
“attacks against trade, commerce, and industry” emanating from the
Reichstag and to defend the “interests of the estate of industry and trade.”
It listed ‹ve general aims: the protection of “economic freedom” against
onerous workplace legislation; the elimination of “one-sided” taxation
policies at the Reich, provincial, and local levels; an end to “burdens” that
were imposed on commerce, small business, and industry and favored
other social groups; the prevention of “one-sided legislation” that privileged individual “classes”; and the maintenance of a balance between
“duties and rights” in the social order and state.80 Four days later, at the
founding meeting in Saarbrücken, chaired by Richard Schmidt of the
AVBS and attended by some eight hundred local businessmen, discussion
of the new organization was largely shaped by corporatist categories and
assumptions. Tille, who drew on his recent political writings to set the tone
for the meeting, de‹ned the Hansabund as the new representative of the
interests of the “estate of industry and trade,” which included employers in
the building and artisanal trades, commerce and transportation, and mining and large-scale heavy industry. Its purpose, he maintained, was to
arrest the declining numbers and political in›uence of businessmen-delegates or “productive employers” (gewerbliche Unternehmer)—in relation
to the other Berufsstände (agricultural producers, white-collar workers,
civil servants, and wage earners)—in the Landtage and especially in the
Reichstag.81 Tille’s argument was followed by speeches about excessive
state social policy, tax burdens, and the need for the self-organization of
the “estate of industry and trade.” The speakers included Arthur Olle, gen-

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

193

eral secretary of the AVBS; master painter Wilhelm Schmelzer, speaking
on behalf of the local Handwerk; and Weisdorff. The meeting ended with
a unanimous vote on a resolution calling for corporatist forms of economic interest representation.
The over eight hundred members of the Hansabund and supporters
of its efforts who have assembled in the Saalbau in Saarbrücken on 23
July 1909 warmly welcome the political consolidation [Zusammenschluss] of trade, commerce, and industry in the context of the Hansabund. They are convinced that only a solid occupational [berufsständische] organization, which maintains its distance equally from
party politics and confessional questions, is capable of establishing
the political in›uence of the estate of industry and trade [Gewerbe- und Handelsstand ] commensurate with its signi‹cance to the economic life of the people. Only by bringing the fundamental interests
of productive employers to bear on all political parties and by sending
more productive employers, proportionate to the number of their
voters, into legislative bodies will the estate of industry and trade be
able to guarantee in the long run legislation that will promote its fundamental interests and thus also the foundations of the economic
well-being of the German Reich.82
In this context, corporatist discourse helped forge a broad unity of
interests, under the direction of heavy industry, among a variety of businessmen and employers from both small and large businesses in the Saar—
a coalition of employers that also drew on the linkages established by earlier efforts to build antiunion organizations and funds throughout the
region. The initial announcement was signed by local employers from the
ranks of the artisanal trades, the construction industry, small retailing,
banking, and heavy industry, including most of the politically active
industrialists and their representatives (Tille, Weisdorff, Louis Röchling,
Theodor Müller, and Louis Vopelius) and all of the leading business organizations (the VWGWISI, the SGVDESI, the AVSI, and the Saar Chamber of Commerce).83 The ‹rst meeting of the Saarbrücken chapter produced an executive committee comprising Schmidt from the artisanal
trades, businessman Heinrich Simon of Sulzbach from commerce, and
Weisdorff from heavy industry. A similar occupational parity was
achieved in the election of the 150-member governing council, which drew
forty members each from Handwerk, commerce, and heavy industry; its

194

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

remaining thirty members were chosen from among the ranks of local
white-collar workers—that is, from the managerial and clerical personnel
employed by local ‹rms. By early November 1909, the Saarbrücken chapter of the Hansabund reported a total of eleven hundred members. Nevertheless, the dominance of heavy industry was secured in a number of areas,
ranging from the ‹nances available to the new organization, which mostly
came from heavy industry, to the in›uence of Tille, who, as the managing
director of the local chapter, was responsible for running its day-to-day
affairs and representing its interests in the governing council of the
national organization.84
Yet the articulation of employer economic interests within this corporatist understanding of the Hansabund had little to do with what historians have long referred to as traditional, anticapitalist, or “feudal-conservative” conceptions of social order. Nearly all of the speakers at the ‹rst
meeting of the Saar branch criticized government social and taxation policies not for their failure to sustain or promote “preindustrial” business
practices or feudal models of economic organization but, rather, for their
violation of the “free wage contract” and their subversion of the putatively
natural relationship between wages and job performance. Far from
demanding protectionist legislation and legal privileges, they claimed to be
supporting “economic freedom” or “free trade,” employer “rights,” and
entrepreneurial initiative. In his speech on behalf of small shopkeepers, for
example, Wilhelm Weiten de‹ned the “tradesman” in terms that resonated
with the masculine, capitalist self-image (long propagated by Tille himself)
of most businessmen and industrialists: “The business owner [Gewerbetreibender] . . . is an employer who relies on his own initiative; an independent man, who has his own business, who is paid [a wage or salary] by no
man and cannot be dismissed from employment by anyone, who is integrally connected to his business, from which he incurs huge risks but also,
if he is capable, from which he earns a pro‹t.” Indeed, the rhetoric of local
Hansabund leaders bears no trace of precapitalist, antimodernist ideologies of “economic despair” long identi‹ed by historians; rather, their
claims and aspirations were expressed in an ideological framework that
was self-consciously “modern” and forward-looking and grounded in a
vision of economic progress.85 Thus Tille reiterated his claims about the
generative activities of “productive employers” and the “estate of industry
and trade” as the central Berufsstand of the new industrial era, which
“under its own steam would steer its own course toward its own goals”;
and Olle addressed the role of the Hansabund in bringing about a new era

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

195

of prosperity for German business as the result of “the old, glorious German Hansa of past centuries” being “reborn in modern guise.”86
Perhaps most telling, this new corporatism distanced the political
demands and self-de‹nitions of the Gewerbe- und Handelsstand from the
policies and ideological orientations of the protectionist agrarians and
Mittelstand. In this regard, Weisdorff clearly articulated the opposition of
heavy industry to all “enemies of economic life,” either from the “left” or
the “right.” If the former brought the “suffocating pressure toward equality,” the latter, he argued, threatened economic expansion in an era of
global markets with a stultifying “traditionalism”—the economic self-limitations intrinsic to the “eternally conservative.” In between these two
positions, Weisdorff continued, “lives freedom of trade, economic freedom, the freedom to realize . . . the value of one’s mental and bodily abilities in useful creation, in free labor.”87 From the perspective of Mittelstand
aims, Weiten explicitly contested the economic demands and the very
schemes of social classi‹cation of the “so-called Mittelstand movement.”
In a sustained re›ection on the “occupational estate” of productive
employers, he rejected attempts to locate small retailers, artisans, and
Beamten within a single Berufsstand, but he also rejected the category
gewerblicher Mittelstand for its arbitrary closures.
The productive Mittelstand is also nothing special in and of itself.
Who wants to say where it begins and where it ends? Why should the
smallest and the largest employers be excluded from it? There are no
‹xed boundaries. Whoever is a small business owner today will perhaps already be a medium-sized business owner in one year and in ten
years a large business owner; and it is not true that there are burdens
that hamper only small business or only big business. In the long run,
all have to bear these burdens.88
Not surprisingly, Tille’s industrially oriented, dynamically capitalist, and
self-consciously modern variant of corporatism dominated discussions of
the local branch and its coalition-building efforts, publications, and educational courses, for which Tille’s four-volume Die Berufsstandspolitik des
Gewerbe- und Handelsstandes served as the textbook.89
Indeed, the failure of the Hansabund to conform to this corporatist
vision eventually generated local opposition to its national directorate.
Saar employers accused the national organization of failing to represent
the occupational interests of the “industrial and commercial estate.” This

196

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

was evident in its neglect of the latter’s economic concerns—particularly
strategies to reduce the amount of social legislation and to enact legal measures to curb trade union activity—and also in its pandering to political
parties of the Left.90 Moreover, the Hansabund was conceived in the Saar
as a “occupational-political” organization of the “estate of industry and
commerce” rather than a political party or an economic association with
political aims. As such, it was supposed to represent the economic interests
of the entire estate of industry and trade in the parliamentary realm.
According to Tille, the Hansabund failed to do this in two ways: it
neglected the economic interests of the productive Bürgertum, and it failed
to embrace all members of the occupational estate—namely, the white collar and industrial workers who rejected the class-political aims of the labor
movement and the “native” (bodenständig) and patriotic workers of the
yellow unions.91 For these reasons, Saar employers, along with other representatives of heavy industry, withdrew their support for the Hansabund
in the summer of 1911.
In the ‹nal years before 1914, these frustrated ambitions—compounded by the results of the Reichstag elections of 1912, from which the
SPD emerged as the largest party in Germany—prompted German industrialists to pursue their corporatist commitments in other ways. Within the
“occupational estate” of industrial producers itself, the leaders of German
heavy industry began to help forge nationwide organizational links
between the CVDI and the yellow union movement. In 1910, the latter created the aforementioned League of German Company Unions and shortly
thereafter joined with the League of Patriotic Workers’ Associations—a
national confederation of workers’ organizations that were not speci‹c to
any company or industry—in the Council of National Workers’ and
Occupational Associations. The council eventually organized an antisocialist alliance of laborers from a variety of trades and industries, including factory workers, artisans, retail workers, and sailors.92 To strengthen
this “bulwark against the red danger,” the CVDI established of‹cial ties to
the council in December 1912, lending publicistic and ‹nancial support to
the company and patriotic unions in the ‹nal prewar years. In the Saar,
similar ties were established between the Employers’ League of Saar
Industry and the regional federation of company unions. These were
aimed at forging “a closer union among all employers, managers and clerical workers, and wage laborers of the productive economy,” to help “foster the feeling of occupational consciousness within the entire industrial
and commercial estate.”93

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

197

At the same time, the CVDI began reinvigorating its efforts to win the
support of the Mittelstand of small producers. In the summer of 1911,
CVDI leaders joined with representatives from the Agrarian League to
assist in the creation of the nationalist Imperial-German Mittelstand
League. Promoting the alliance of “Handwerk and industry,” according to
CVDI chairman Max Roetger, was necessary to halt the steady advance of
social democracy and social legislation that subverted employer interests.
Tille, who became the leading advocate of Mittelstandspolitik within
heavy industry, cast this initiative in distinctly corporatist terms. In his
programmatic article entitled “The Industrial League” and in his speeches
before the Imperial-German Mittelstand League in 1912, he stressed the
importance of small business to the unity of the industrial estate. Small
workshops and commercial businesses, he argued, were equally burdened
by the social legislation that privileged wage earners. Much more serious,
however, was the growing power of Marxist “prejudices” widespread
within the small business community itself. These included “moralistic”
criticisms of entrepreneurs as “robber barons” and hostility toward capitalist forms of investment, pro‹t making, and managerial-entrepreneurial
(or nonphysical) labor. A broad-ranging coalition or “industrial league”
involving producers from the mining, manufacturing, commercial, transportation, housing, retailing, and artisanal sectors therefore would help
root out socialist ideas in the Mittelstand, consolidate the occupational
unity of the entire estate of industry and trade, and defend the capitalist
industrial order.94
These corporatist initiatives were central to the wider process of ideological realignment taking place on the German right. During the ‹nal
prewar years, representatives from German heavy industry and agriculture attempted for the ‹rst time to forge a genuinely populist coalition, by
actively appealing to the interests of small-scale producers of the Mittelstand and the peasant classes on the basis of a radical-nationalist appeal.95
By the spring of 1913, a wide range of groups were actively pursuing organization contacts, including the CVDI, the Agrarian League, the Christian
Union of Peasants’ Associations, the Imperial-German Mittelstand
League, and several nationalist pressure groups. The main representatives
from heavy industry pushing for this realignment were the Ruhr industrialists grouped around Alfred Hugenberg and Max Roetger of the CVDI,
Emil Kirdorf of the Rhine-Westphalian Coal Syndicate, and the Saar
industrialists led by Alexander Tille (until his death in 1912) and Louis
Röchling.96 Their goal was to forge a common political alliance organized

198

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

around commitments to antiunion legislation (especially laws against
picketing), a cessation of state Sozialpolitik, antisocialism, and German
imperialism. Finally, representatives of all of these interest groups, along
with leaders of the Pan-German League and the Imperial League against
Social Democracy, met in Leipzig to announce the formation of the Cartel
of Productive Estates in August 1913. As its program suggested, the principal tasks of this alliance of the main productive “estates” or occupations
were to unify industrialists, agrarians, and Mittelständler in defense of
their economic interests; to maintain “authority in all economic enterprises”; to secure price guarantees and the “protection of those willing to
work” (strikebreakers); and to defend against social democracy and
“socialist heresy.”97 In recognition of the “common existential interests of
industry, Handwerk, and agriculture,” according to CVDI secretary Ferdinand Schweighoffer, the cartel emphasized the “necessity of these three
Berufsstände standing side by side in all fundamental questions related to
our economic and social policy.”98
In addition, the cartel’s call for the formation of an “economic parliament” with decision-making powers in the areas of economic and social
policy revealed the growing interest of key sectors of heavy industry in a
state-sponsored coup d’etat or in new corporatist strategies for bypassing
the existing parliamentary and constitutional order altogether. The
strongest public signal for this commitment within domestic heavy industry came from Max Schlenker, who replaced Tille as head of the Saar
Chamber of Commerce after the latter’s sudden death in 1912. In his essay
of June 1913 entitled “Revision of the Reichstag Suffrage or the Creation
of an Imperial Upper House?” Schlenker criticized recent debates in the
Reichstag over the Army Bill, which proposed direct taxation in the form
of business and property taxes. He warned that the Reichstag had
“embarked on a path that must ‹ll the [productive] estates with the utmost
concern about the future.” In response to this most recent invasion of the
Reichstag into the realm of private property and to the deeper problem of
the dearth of businessmen-delegates in the Reichstag, Schlenker proposed
two possible constitutional solutions: (1) changes in the electoral laws (e.g.,
property quali‹cations and residency requirements) to guarantee the number of businessmen delegates in the Reichstag and (2) the creation of an
imperial upper house composed of representatives of the occupational
estates (Berufsstände). According to Schlenker, only constitutional change
could prevent legislation from restricting further the “discretionary power
of the employer in his factory” and could shield this “aristocracy of labor”
from the tyranny of the “unpropertied majority.”99

Corporatist Discourse and Saar Heavy Industry

Schlenker’s call for an imperial upper house and electoral reforms
found growing support among German industrialists. Indeed, growing
hostility toward mass politics spawned a number of possible schemes for
constitutional revision in 1913, emanating from the Ruhr and Saar in particular and published in the leading press organs of heavy industry.100 Yet
demands for property quali‹cations to existing imperial and Prussian suffrage laws and designs for the creation of an upper chamber that would act
as a countervailing force to the Reichstag found a growing audience
among even wider sectors of German heavy industry. They were raised in
the context of discussions within the CVDI and in the Deutsche Handelstag (the collective forum of the chambers of commerce), and by 1913, these
goals, in more limited forms, were winning adherents from the ranks of the
export-oriented and liberal free-trading ‹rms of the Hansabund, the Association of Saxon Industrialists, and the BdI.101 The general sense of domestic crisis within the ranks of German industrialists in the wake of the Social
Democratic electoral victories of 1912 and fears about competition in the
global economy therefore rendered corporatist ideological appeals
increasingly attractive to growing numbers of representatives from the
‹nished goods industries and smaller-scale manufacturing. In this way,
corporatist discourse contributed to the ideological convergence between
employer organizations and the nationalist pressure groups of the radical
Right after 1913.

epilogue

Toward a Genealogy of Fascist Corporatism

The emergence of corporatist discourse in the Saar was in some ways distinctive to the region, especially in terms of its relatively systematic theoretical elaboration, but it anticipated the general corporatist turn in the
politics of German and European industrialists and radical nationalists in
subsequent decades. In Germany, it was redeployed in relation to the
growing interpenetration of public and private power during the First
World War, during which new structures of interest representation and
economic planning that involved employers, workers, and state of‹cials
emerged; in opposition to the formation in November 1918 of a “central
works community” (Zentralarbeitsgemeinschaft), which brought employer
associations and trade unions together in a common system of collective
bargaining and state arbitration; in opposition to the role of state of‹cials
and parliamentary politicians in the formulation of national economic
policy in relation to tariffs, wages, ‹nance, currency, and foreign trade
during the Weimar Republic; and in response to the crisis of productivity
and unemployment brought on by the global economic collapse of
1929–30. Indebted to ‹xed ontological distinctions between ideology or
discourse and the economy, as well as between the state, the public sphere,
and the industrial workplace, historians have largely overlooked the productivity of this version of right-wing corporatism: namely, the capacity to
assemble a disparate array of linguistic resources into a new ideological
con‹guration, which articulated racist visions of a social order organized
by self-administering “occupational estates” to a modern rationality of
industrial management; and its capacity to effect changes to the social
200

relations of the industrial workplace and the wider domains of industrial
interest representation and employer politics. We must look to these
capacities if we are to appreciate the ideological appeal of corporatist discourse within the ranks of German heavy industry after the First World
War. During the 1920s and 1930s, corporatism proved to be an important
‹eld of ideological debate and convergence between the leaders of German
heavy industry and the National Socialists—a convergence that brought
them together in their attacks on the Weimar Republic during the early
1930s and in the subsequent elaboration of the Nazi project after 1933.
Rearticulated versions of the new managerial rationality and “scienti‹c management” explored in this study were taken up in new institutes
of industrial sociology and social policy, especially the Ruhr-based German Institute for Technical Labor Training (Deutsches Institut für technische Arbeitschulung, hereafter Dinta) in Düsseldorf. Established in 1925
by Ruhr industrialists (especially Albert Vögler of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke) and led by the engineer Karl Arnhold, Dinta developed new labor
policies and training programs and disseminated information about
schemes of industrial rationalization, “human economy” (Menschenökonomie), “human management” (Menschenführung), and company
social policy, with the aim of reaching employers throughout German
industry. It sought to transform the “soul of the worker”—to cultivate
obedient workers, imbued with the virtues of military discipline and a
belief in social hierarchy, who would reject class-based trade unions,
socialism, and communism and come to celebrate their “joy in work.” This
ideological project centered on efforts to induct the male worker into the
world of individual “performance” (Leistung) on the job, loyalty to the
collective “works community” (Werksgemeinschaft), and pride in one’s
occupational “estate.”1 It also entailed the biopolitical disciplining of the
industrial workforce, which meant the introduction of gendered workplace schemes and measures related to social and racial hygiene and
extending to workers’ familial lives off the job, including exercise and
sporting activities, nutrition and health care provisions, schools for household pedagogy and rationalization, and services for maternity and infant
care.2 By 1930, Dinta was active in nearly three hundred German and Austrian ‹rms, mostly in the iron and steel, metalworking, and mining industries; its ideological terms—references to the workers’ “estate,” the “works
community,” and job “performance”—suffused the political language of
German industrialists, who sought to destroy the system of collective bargaining and labor arbitration during the Weimar era.3

202

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

These de‹nitions of the Werksgemeinschaft were generated in postwar discussions that brought together industrialists and their representatives and various politicians and spokesmen from the right-wing organizations and political parties, including the Nazis, who invoked a corporatist
conception of workplace organization as part of their larger plans for the
“creation of a corporate social order” (ständische Aufbau).4 But it was
mostly the Dinta model, emanating from the ranks of heavy industry, that
was integrated into the labor and social policies of the Third Reich. The
institute, including its director Arnhold, was seamlessly “coordinated”
into the Nazi system after it was renamed the Of‹ce for Factory Leadership and Occupational Training and was taken up in the activities and programs of the German Labor Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, hereafter
DAF), the main social policy organization of the Nazi era.5 Most of
Dinta’s principal ideological terms and demands, especially its emphasis
on “performance” and the “works community” (Betriebsgemeinschaft),
were written into the labor law of the Third Reich and institutionalized in
Nazi wage policies. Indeed, during this transition, representatives of German heavy industry successfully lobbied on behalf of a corporatist vision
of “occupational estates” that would secure the prerogatives of the
employer in the workplace and institutionalize their scheme for relative
employer autonomy and industrial “self-administration” in relation to
factory social policy, and they were the principal authors of the Law on
the Organization of National Labor of 20 January 1934.6 For their part,
the Nazi leaders of the DAF reformulated their corporatist plans for
ständische Aufbau in relation to the industrial workplace during the summer and fall of 1933, in ways that accommodated demands for autonomy
and employer prerogative emanating from the ranks of German heavy
industry.7
After 1933, corporatist references to occupational “estates” and the
“works community” combined with racial concerns about the worker’s
body, individual “performance,” and the social and biological reproductive
functions of the working-class family to shape ideological discourses about
work and newly recon‹gured factory regimes during the Nazi era. Bioracial
corporatist terms and assumptions ‹gured centrally in the writings and
policies of Nazi physicians and scientists, industrial sociologists and
ef‹ciency experts, and DAF functionaries; and they constituted the core of
racist de‹nitions of work, occupational hierarchies, and social order in the
much-vaunted “performance community” (Leistungsgemeinschaft) of the
Third Reich.8 This was visible, for example, in the rationalized industrial

Epilogue

203

workplaces of the automotive ‹rm Daimler-Benz, at the electrical ‹rm
Siemens, and in the plans for the National Socialist model factory of the
Volkswagen concern, which was to introduce rationalization measures for
its main plant in conjunction with the formation of a new “worker elite”
created by means of vocational training and a company policy of bioracial
“selection.”9 These racial distinctions and social policies became especially
important to the “factory community” during the Second World War,
when German industrialists and managers incorporated millions of
“racially” foreign slave laborers into the Nazi economy.10
The prewar “corporative antiparliamentarism” of German industrialists proved equally consequential for the history of labor relations and
parliamentary politics during the Weimar era. As Dirk Stegmann demonstrated, the corporatist demands and experiments proposed by Saar and
other German industrialists, especially in the context of the Cartel of Productive Estates of 1913, were revived during the First World War. Their
leading exponents were among the organizers and supporters of various
initiatives related to the formation of a German-dominated customs union
in Europe (Mitteleuropa), often orchestrated by leaders of the Pan-German League, and to the creation in the fall of 1917 of the German Fatherland Party, which attempted to remobilize a broad-ranging coalition
among the forces of the political Right on behalf of annexationist and
imperialist war aims and to counter threats of democratization in Germany.11 The industrialists and industry representatives who supported the
party, especially leaders of the CVDI, were particularly concerned to resist
demands for an end to the three-class voting system in Prussia emanating
from the Reichstag and to bring about constitutional changes in the direction of a corporatist political order, including an “economic parliament”
and a “corporatist electoral law” organized by productive estate.12 The
center of this activity shifted to Rhineland-Westphalia after the war and
revolution, when plans for corporatist economic and social (re)organization were most systematically debated among industrialists in the Ruhr,
even though its in›uence was curbed during the mid-1920s by the accommodationist line adopted by the new umbrella organization for German
employers, the Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie (hereafter RDI),
and its leader Paul Silverberg. As early as May 1920, Vögler, head of the
VDESI, was disparaging the newly created parliamentary order in favor of
schemes of “economic self-administration” for the resolution of “all economic questions by means of a corporatist [berufsständisch] economic parliament.”13 Subsequently, these discussions took place most frequently in

204

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

the meetings of the Langnamverein, the main employers’ organization for
the Rhineland and Westphalia, and in the meetings and congresses of the
League for a National Economy and Works Community (Bund für
Nationalwirtschaft und Werksgemeinschaft), a radical right-wing pressure
group created in 1926 under the leadership of the Pan-German Paul Bang,
a close ally of Alfred Hugenberg and Vögler. Leaders of this latter organization combined racist de‹nitions of economic competition and industrial
management, demands for the “self-administration of the economy” by
representatives of the leading productive estates, and attacks on the
“Marxist social policy” and parliamentary government of the Weimar
Republic in a “modern” capitalist vision that emphasized the virtues of a
“free economy.”14
This articulation of an “estatist” social imaginary to a technocratic
capitalist rationality characterized many of the right-wing corporatist
projects across Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. Corporatist theories
developed in all European countries during and after the First World War,
when powerful pressures for economic regulation and planning, which
involved new state institutions and ministries alongside organized industrial interest groups, were created as the means by which to order the
chaotic dynamics of industrial capitalism.15 During the 1920s and 1930s,
radical nationalist and conservative groups put forward their own corporatist schemes for industrial social order, which were variously implemented in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Austria, and Germany. Far from
being the backward-looking, restorationist, or even anticapitalist ideological projects that appear in many histories of corporatism, the most
important right-wing versions of corporatism, especially their authoritarian and fascist variants, were complex ideological formations, which generally proposed forward-looking schemes for the creation of producers
“estates” or chambers and varying measures of state planning that
included visions of employer prerogative and “self-administration” of
trades and industries, the reinforcement of capitalist property relations
and markets, and autarkic—though not isolated—regions of economic
development. These corporatist schemes were forged in wide-ranging
political debates between fascist politicians and intellectuals, fascist
employers, and conservative industrialists and their representatives—
debates that involved demarcating the corporatist modernisms of European industrialists from the dirigiste, protectionist, and “guild” models of
corporatism favored by small-scale producers and retailers or the industrial bargaining models of corporatism favored or encouraged by certain

Epilogue

labor leaders and reformist employers. This was the case with French
industrialists, who favored legal recognition of their own cartels in the
1930s; Spanish industrialists during the Francoist reorganization of the
economy during the late 1930s; and Italian industrialists and nationalist
corporatists like Antonio Benni and Alfredo Rocco, who successfully outmaneuvered supporters of a worker-centered syndicalist corporatism in
order to establish a corporatist framework of industrial production that
favored the authority and interests of heavy industry during the late 1920s
and early 1930s.16
In Germany, corporatist modernism competed with other variants of
corporatism during the 1920s. By the early 1930s, it became the principal
ideological discourse through which representatives from domestic heavy
industry criticized the system of state labor arbitration, social policy, and
constitutional structure of the Weimar Republic. Most historians of corporatist ideology and Nazism have focused on the corporatisms of small
producers (German retailers and shop owners), with their calls for guildlike organizations and guarantees of state protection. Indeed, Hitler and
several other Nazi leaders—including Gottfried Feder, Otto Wilhelm
Wagner, Gregor Strasser, and Max Frauendorfer—were attracted to
dirigiste corporatist solutions to class con›ict and the volatility of capitalist economies, especially to the “neoromantic” theories of the Viennese
professor of political economy Ottmar Spahn.17 Nevertheless, Spann’s
theories left much more scope for the self-organization and autonomy of
German industry, and the Nazis proved willing to drop some of their
seemingly anticapitalist positions as early as 1926 and 1928.18 Moreover,
small producers’ demands for corporative organization of the economy
competed with corporatist theories that were ‹rmly anchored in capitalist
rationalities, most notably Walther Rathenau’s and Wichard von Moellendorff’s blueprints, developed during the First World War, for a “German collective economy” (Deutsche Gemeinwirtschaft), as well as the corporatist strategies emanating from the ranks of heavy industry, especially
in the Ruhr. From 1930 on, German industrialists and their representatives debated the latter in the meetings and congresses of the leading industrial organizations, including the Langnamverein, Bergbau-Verein, RDI,
and Deutscher Industrie- und Handelstag, as well as in their own newspapers and newsletters, including Der Arbeitgeber, the Mitteilungen der
Vereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverbände, and the Deutsche
Führerbriefe, a newsletter connected to heavy industry via the Langnamverein and the Central European Economic Congress (Mittel-

206

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

europäischer Wirtschaftstag). The principal exponents of corporatist
industrial social order within the ranks of heavy industry included Albert
Vögler, Max Schlenker, Fritz Thyssen, August Heinrichsbauer, Karl Vorwerck, Paul Karrenbrock, Walter Heinrich, and Hans Reupke; the last
was both a member of the executive committee of the RDI and a Nazi,
who sought to bring the corporatist interests of the Nazis in line with those
of heavy industry.19 By 1930, therefore, German industrialists were
proposing various corporatist schemes for economic order and constitutional revision, though these proposals were decidedly not the same as
those emanating from the ranks of small producers organized in the Mittelstand organizations or from a number of Nazis. Rather, they were
explicitly de‹ned as measures that would defend the “free economy” from
the interference of trade unions, political parties, the parliament, and an
intrusive state.20
During the fall of 1932, when leading representatives of domestic
heavy industry and the RDI were negotiating with the Nazis, including
Hitler, to secure guarantees against excessive state intervention, they made
their case in defense of employer “freedom” in terms of their desire for the
“self-organization of the corporatively organized economy,” and they
were not without success.21 In response, Hitler “pulped” the Nazi “immediate economic program,” sidelined the protectionist small-producer (mittelständisch) corporatisms of Gottfried Feder and Otto Wilhelm Wagner,
and appointed the industry-friendly Walther Funk, former chief editor of
the Berlin Exchange Newspaper, to head the agency in charge of the “private economy” within the Nazi Party.22 Moreover, after their “seizure” of
power, Nazi and DAF leaders curbed their earlier calls for dirigiste “corporatist reconstruction” that would limit the prerogatives of employers
during the summer and fall of 1933, in favor of a vague plan for economic
reorganization that would leave autonomy and decision-making powers in
the hands of German employers and would not dismantle the structures of
private property, market relations, and the pro‹t mechanism—a reorientation of Nazi corporatism that was brought about in discussions with and
conciliatory responses to German industrialists and their representatives.
These discussions were facilitated by the Institute for Corporatism (Institut für Ständewesen), founded by the Nazi industrialist Fritz Thyssen and
the Nazi Josef Klein of I.G. Farben in May 1933; the Of‹ce for Corporatist Reconstruction (Amt für ständischen Aufbau) of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (hereafter NSDAP), an of‹ce
directed by Max Frauendorfer; and direct contacts between leaders of

Epilogue

207

German heavy industry and Nazi of‹cials over the course of 1933 and
1934.23 The gradual process by which industrialists negotiated with Nazi
leaders from 1931 to 1933 therefore involved not only the growing willingness of Nazi leaders to modify their “anticapitalist” views and subordinate
their “socialist” wing in order to accommodate leading industrialists from
domestic heavy industry; it also involved the steady disquali‹cation of certain corporatist projects in favor of others, especially versions favored by
heavy industry—not, as many historians have long argued, the abandonment of “corporatism” altogether.24
Indeed, after the repudiation of anticapitalist elements within the
Nazi Party and the turn away from the state protectionism and the general
project of ständische Aufbau elaborated on behalf of the Mittlestand and
peasantry in 1934, a new framework of corporatist relations between state
and industry was established as part of the rearmament drive of the 1930s.
This new system of Reich, industry, and business groups and an architecture of cartels, established from 1933 to 1936, was designed to involve German employers in the industrial expansion and military rearmament policies of the Nazi state—a process that involved hard negotiations between
representatives of German industry and state and party of‹cials, not state
efforts at “dragooning private enterprise” into “serving” Nazi “desires.”25
Thus the integration of the RDI into the new Imperial Estate of German
Industry (Reichsstand der deutschen Industrie) in July 1933 was the outcome of joint efforts between Nazi of‹cials and industrialists within the
RDI—namely, ‹gures like Fritz Thyssen and Jakob Reichert of the
VDESI. During the summer of 1933, the new economics minister, Director
Kurt Schmitt of the Allianz insurance company, negotiated with Hitler
important spaces of self-regulation and autonomy for heavy industry in
the new structure of cartels, leaving little room for the protectionist corporatism of the Mittelstand.26 Moreover, the subsequent reorganization of
industrial organizations to include new committees and “rings,” which
took place under the direction of Albert Speer from December 1941 to
May 1942, was also the outcome of joint efforts between representatives of
German industry and state and party of‹cials. Inspired by Vögler and
overseen by Walther Schieber, a former manager for I.G. Farben and
director of a ‹ber company in Thuringia during the 1930s, these agencies
were chaired mostly by representatives from Germany’s leading one hundred industrial ‹rms under the Nazi (and now Speer’s) slogan of “selfadministration.” As Adam Tooze compellingly demonstrates, these organizations evolved into a “complex structure of cooperation” that drew on

208

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

the “enthusiasm” of German industrialists and their representatives, especially from the coal, steel, chemical, automotive, and aircraft industries,
who actively facilitated German plans for rearmament and imperial
expansion on the continent.27
In light of these connections and shared ideological commitments, we
need to re-think historiographical interpretations of the “Nazi economy”
as a “planned economy” imposed by autonomous state actors from above
in ways that subverted the “normal” workings of capitalism or interpretations that stress Nazi efforts, dictated by state of‹cials, to build a “nationalistic-statist economic order” within a broadly capitalist framework.28
The general process of corporatist restructuring described here is probably
best characterized in terms of increasing “governmentalization of the
state” in the formation of a new regime of capital accumulation, rather
than increasing state intervention into an autonomous economic realm
during the Third Reich.29 This involved the strategic recodi‹cation of
existing domains and practices of economic (self-)governance—the redirection of the independent activity of industrial interest groups into the
expanding and evolving corporatist structures of the Nazi state. These
structures certainly became mandatory for all employers, but they were
put in place and managed by political-economic leaders drawn from the
ranks of the Nazi movement and German industry. In these new corporatist con‹gurations, they became part of a highly dynamic and restlessly
expansionist regime of capital accumulation and mode of regulation. The
latter regime constituted a repressively antiunion, militarized, and autarkic version of Fordism, which rested on a new balance of production and
consumption imperatives; new regulatory mechanisms for pricing, credit,
and industrial policy; enhanced schemes of rationalized mass production;
and a new architecture of economic interest representation.30
This new regime did not satisfy the demands of all German employers
across industrial sectors, but the lack of complete agreement among all
businessmen and industrialists—a constitutive element of any capitalist
system—should not obscure the important contributions of many leading
German industrialists and their representatives to the collapse of the
Weimar Republic and the rise of the NSDAP in 1932–33. These contributions are not best understood in terms of isolated tactical positions
adopted by certain industrial leaders in the ebb and ›ow of political calculation from 1930 to 1933—not least because the connections between
industrialists and the Nazi movement varied considerably during these
years.31 Rather, their involvement should be understood in terms of their

Epilogue

209

relation to the corporatist political and ideological logic, anchored in the
Papen-Hitler coalition, that ‹nally destroyed the Republic. Moreover, the
disagreements between and among German employers and Nazis should
not obscure the role of industrialists, often as both businessmen and
Nazis, in the policy-making processes of the Nazi state after 1933, including during the Second World War, as the total war economy drew on the
technical expertise and resources of German industrialists in what was a
corporatist structure of industrial production. Finally, recognition of the
important changes in economic developments during the 1930s and 1940s
and disagreements between and among German industrialists and Nazi
political leaders should not overlook the capitalist-technocratic orientation of their authoritarian-corporatist projects—corporatisms that were
not the same as prewar corporatism in the Saar but whose central terms
and propositions and whose institutional forms were certainly anticipated
by the latter.
This study focuses on the prewar era in the industrial Saar and cannot
fully trace these complex genealogies into the 1920s and 1930s, but it can
offer a glimpse of the fascist potential embedded in this ideological transformation and of the complex connections between individuals and corporatist ideology, by examining brie›y the subsequent biographies of the
two most important industrial representatives from the Saar: Max
Schlenker and Herrmann Röchling. Schlenker remained in charge of the
main Saar business organizations during the First World War and, in this
capacity, was instrumental in orchestrating ‹nancial and organizational
support from Saar heavy industry—along with other important industrial
interests from the Ruhr and organized in the CVDI—for the new German
Fatherland Party created in 1917.32 In 1925, he moved to the Ruhr and
became the principal managing director of the Langnamverein, and he
served as a spokesman and leading “organic intellectual” from the ranks
of Ruhr heavy industry during the Weimar era. From his position in the
Ruhr, Schlenker served the cause of employer-friendly rationalization and
the articulation of new ideologies of workplace management and company
social policy, in his capacity as a member of the managing committee of
Dinta.33 But his most important ideological and organizational contributions to the politics of industrial interest groups during the Weimar years
were related to his role as manager of the Langnamverein.
In this capacity, Schlenker was one of the leading advocates of a corporatist restructuring of the political order as a means of destroying the
parliamentary and social welfare systems of the Weimar Republic. In 1925,

210

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

along with Paul Reusch, general director of the Gutehoffnungshütte and
chairman of the Langnamverein, he authored a set of political demands
designed to counter the in›uence of those industrialists, such as Paul Silverberg and his allies within the RDI, who sought accommodation with
the SPD and the institutions of the Weimar Republic. The document
amounted to a general attack on the foundations of the Weimar settlement, with its demands for constitutional revision that would curb the
spending or the “extraordinary luxury of parliament,” dismantle the compulsory arbitration system for labor disputes, end price supports, rescind
legislation against cartels, and disallow foreign “dumping” and cheap
export credits. Schlenker envisioned a kind of “economic dictatorship”—
enabled by article 48 of the Weimar constitution—that would confer on
the government “especially strong administrative authority” and furnish
the Reich ‹nance minister with a “right to veto in cases involving decisions
coming from all other departments or from the parliament that impose
‹nancial burdens on the budget.”34 These demands were never implemented, and the designs of Schlenker and other Ruhr industrialists were
thwarted during the period of relative stabilization from 1926 to 1929,
when the Silverberg line prevailed in the RDI. In November 1928, however, when the Northwest Group of German Iron and Steel Industrialists
locked 230,000 steelworkers out their factories in an effort to challenge the
decisions of state arbitrators during a wage dispute in the Ruhr, Schlenker
once again played an important and effective role in the “public relations
work” of domestic heavy industry. The action, which targeted the wage
negotiation system in general as a foundation of the Weimar Republic,
was an effort to block unwanted involvement of state agencies and political parties in “the free economy,” in Paul Reusch’s words; and the ‹nal
compromise decision reached by SPD interior minister Carl Severing was
condemned by Schlenker as a step in the direction of socialism.35 The following year, Schlenker became involved in the nationalist agitation over
the Young Plan, with its coordination among a broad range of organizations, including the German Nationalist People’s Party, the Nazi Party,
and the major right-wing veterans’ association, the Stahlhelm. In this ‹rst
mobilization of an emergent “nationalist opposition,” Schlenker helped to
steer leaders of the Langnamverein away from rejection of the new plan
and toward a moderate line accepting its payment terms.36
During the summer of 1930, however, in the midst of economic
depression, Schlenker and other representatives from German heavy
industry began more aggressively to mount their corporatist “political

Epilogue

211

offensive” against the presidential regime of Heinrich Brüning.37 At the
April 1930 meeting of the Langnamverein, Schlenker called on “the German employer” to become politically active in order “to secure his
deserved position at the helm of the state.” He then published an article in
Stahl und Eisen arguing for the need to learn from Mussolini’s corporative
economic experiments in Italy, since the Reich Economic Council in Germany had not been able to contain the power of the parliament, the party
fractions, and the parties. The latter forces, he maintained, had prevented
an “economic policy of greater objectivity [Sachlichkeit].”38 Later that
year, in response to the demands for “economic democracy” emanating
from the SPD, Schlenker called for the formation of a uni‹ed “front”
among employer-parliamentarians, the creation of “political directors” in
all large-scale industrial concerns, and a coalition among old and new
political parties and even sections of youth, who understood the
“signi‹cance of free economic production to the foundation of a people
and state.”39 In 1931, Schlenker stepped up his political activity by publishing articles and undertaking a public speaking tour, mostly to military
schools and meetings of of‹cers, in order to describe the “objective economic situation” and make the case for political change.40 In October 1931,
he participated in the meeting of the Harzburg Front, an important
alliance of the leading elements of the nationalist opposition to the Brüning
cabinet, led by the NSDAP and the German Nationalist People’s Party and
including key representatives from German heavy industry. At this time,
Schlenker emerged as a leading ‹gure in attempts to forge a new authoritarian government of national opposition, under the leadership of Franz
von Papen, who shared the corporatist views of many German industrialists, but with Nazi participation. The aim of Schlenker and other Ruhr
industrialists was to appeal to what they viewed as the “bourgeois-conservative” wing of the Nazi Party, which they hoped would provide the necessary mass support for their own constitutional and economic reforms.41
In the fall of 1932, Schlenker participated in discussions of leading
industrialists (including the October meeting in the Club of Berlin) that
were designed to frustrate a possible “black-brown bloc” between the
Nazis and the Center Party in upcoming elections in November and to
support the Papen regime and “constitutional reform.”42 Like other
employers and their representatives at this stage, Schlenker openly favored
a corporatist extraconstitutional solution to what he perceived to be the
problem of an endangered “free economy.” In an essay that combined
capitalist appeals to the rights of individual employers, criticism of trade

212

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

unions and a “socialistic” state, and corporatist demands for constitutional revision, Schlenker called for the formation of a dictatorial regime
in order to bring about a “healthy economy in a strong state.”
The parties here have for a long time no longer served as the expression [Sprachrohre] of political will in relation to the government and
are no longer indispensable watchdogs [Überwachungsorgane] in the
service of healthy governmental leadership. . . . Now it is necessary to
establish guarantees that these conditions of the past never return.
. . . We must never allow governments that are dependent on the
Reichstag or political parties, as they have been in the past years, to
return under any circumstances. The sense and purpose of constitutional reform is in the end the guarantee of a powerful government
independent of the parties.43
Like the corporatist commitments of other German industrialists and their
representatives, this vision combined demands for political order based on
representation by economic “estate” with capitalist notions of employer
prerogative, individual “performance” at work, the “factory community,”
competitive production, and economic growth. It sought a new regime of
accumulation, which would destroy the power of the trade unions and the
German Left, curb legislation that reduced pro‹ts, and abolish the industrial policy and social welfare guarantees of the Weimar Republic—all of
which were deemed costly to employers and unnecessary interference in
the “free economy.”
Despite his efforts to destroy the Weimar Republic and to bring about
an authoritarian order by means of a government of national concentration involving the National Socialists, the Nazis ultimately forced
Schlenker out of his position as manager of the Langnamverein, owing to
his preference for Papen over Hitler as chancellor.44 This had little to do,
however, with fundamental ideological differences in relation to economic
and political order. Much of what Schlenker had long espoused—the
destruction of parliamentary democracy, the elimination of the trade
unions and collective bargaining, the recon‹guration of industrial class
relations in accordance with the principles of “performance” and the “factory community,” and the direct participation of economic interest organizations in the agencies of the state—was brought about, if in various ways,
during the Third Reich. Schlenker’s wider ideological and political contributions matter most in this context, not the extent of his personal involve-

ment with or direct funding of the Nazi Party or Hitler himself. Schlenker’s
preference for a Papen-led dictatorial regime with Nazi support and his
subsequent removal from leadership in the Langnamverein do not invalidate what became the fascist elements of his economic and political vision.
The postwar biography of Herrmann Röchling illustrates this point
about the multiple articulations of ideological discourse and the crucial
ideological af‹nities between powerful industrialists, their representatives,
and the Nazis during the 1930s and 1940s. Whereas Schlenker was removed
from his position by the Nazis in 1933, Röchling proved capable of being a
successful Saar industrialist, an effective industry spokesman, and a
prominent Nazi. During the interwar period in the Saar, his economic and
political activities both prepared the way for the success of the NSDAP
during the Saar plebiscite of 1935 and facilitated many of the economic,
colonial, and terroristic ambitions of the Nazi regime after 1935. Before
the war, Röchling, the leading proponent of the yellow union movement
and the “works community,” was drawn to the racist ideology of the radical Right, especially the Pan-Germanism of Heinrich Class. Like
Schlenker, the Röchlings, along with Theodor Müller of the Stumm concerns and Edmund Weisdorff of the Burbach steelworks, supported the
annexationist German Fatherland Party, the right-wing formation
anchored in the political-ideological logic of the prewar Cartel of Productive Estates.45
After the German defeat, the separation of the Saar region from Germany, and the onset of French administration of the Saar under a League
of Nations mandate, Röchling became the leader of the German-Saarland
People’s Party (Deutsch-Saarländische Volkspartei, hereafter DSVP) and
the leading nationalist publicist in the region, a one-man “institution” who
set up “Saar of‹ces,” with his social secretary Karl Rupp, in Völklingen
and in other cities in Germany, in order to contest French authority and
in›uence in the region.46 Röchling and other members of the AVSI sponsored the Saar’s own center for industrial sociology and “human management,” the Institute for Labor Science (Anstalt für Arbeitskunde), created
in 1927, which was located in Burbach and supported by all leading ‹rms
of Saar private heavy industry.47 In addition, in 1928, he was one of the
organizers of the League for the Renewal of the Reich (Bund zur
Erneuerung des Reiches), an avowedly antidemocratic corporatist political organization created by Reusch and other industrialists but also
including bankers and landowners and chaired by the former chancellor
and German People’s Party politician Hans Luther. The league called for

214

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

“constitutional reform” that would nullify the independence of the Prussian government, install an authoritarian executive for Germany, and create a new legislative body or “Reich council” composed of representatives
from occupational groups and experts.48 Like the other prominent members of the league, which also included representatives from the Stumm
steelworks in Neunkirchen and the Vopelius glassworks in Sulzbach,
Röchling opposed the “socialism” and radicalism of the Nazis during this
period but did so from an antidemocratic and antiparliamentary corporatist perspective that favored a government of national opposition led by
a strong leader.49
This changed with the appointment of Hitler as chancellor in 1933
and the campaigns for the Saar plebiscite of 1935. Röchling was the principal local architect of the German Front, the multiparty nationalist coalition and propaganda organization formed in May 1933 for the purpose of
mobilizing Saarländer in advance of the plebiscite. He contacted Hitler in
order to begin discussions about establishing the front; took part in its
organizational meetings of 1933 and 1934, which brought the Nazis into
coalition with the DSVP, the Center, and the Economic Party of the Saar;
and participated in the radio, ‹lm, and public speaking activities associated with the front’s nationalist mobilization.50 The front was a massbased organization, which, like the Nazi Party, was organized from the
cell and block (neighborhood) levels upward. It blanketed the region with
nationalist propaganda from 1933 to 1935, saturating and dominating the
local-regional “public sphere” with its messages and demands. This
involved not only exhortations calling for the return of the Saar to Germany in public radio announcements and newspaper articles but also mass
demonstrations, threats, and coercive measures that targeted the neighborhoods and factories. The front’s “opening up and domination of private everyday life” included demonstrations and propaganda activities at
the main iron and steel factories, including the Röchling concerns in
Völkingen, where company celebrations, associations, and facilities were
mobilized on behalf of the nationalist cause and where workers were
forced to participate in Nazi symbolic practices, ranging from ›ying the
Nazi ›ag to using the “Hitler greeting.”51 By May 1934, Röchling had
obviously become comfortable with Nazi radicalism and “brown terror.”
In an article for the journal Westland, he openly threatened the antifascist
opposition to reincorporation of the Saar.
There are some Saarländer who have decided in favor of French citizenship. We have marked their names in the “of‹cial journal,” and we

Epilogue

215

have taken notice of them. But there might also be the other sort
whose names we do not know. We think that it would be good for
them if they were on the other side of the border when the plebiscite is
over.52
Moreover, Röchling had given up his earlier misgivings about the economic policies of Hitler and the NSDAP and was insisting that Hitler and
the Nazis promised not only national renewal but the “reconstruction of
the German economy.”53
After the plebiscite in January 1935 and the reincorporation of the
Saar into Germany, Röchling of‹cially became a member of the Nazi
Party—at a time when the “old ‹ghters” of the party were being pushed
aside—and its most important industrialist in the Saar, where he took part
in efforts to forge the “works community” by means of ideological indoctrination, coercion, and terror.54 This involved the implementation of the
new labor laws and institutions, along with their accompanying terminology, which Röchling had staunchly supported; the incorporation of DAF
activities and social policy programs; and seeking out enemies of the new
order among the labor force in order to secure a “cleansed works community.”55 The labor policies designed to consolidate the “works community”
and secure greater workplace “performance” among workers radically
expanded in the context of war after 1939, when Röchling and his of‹cials
availed themselves of the “work reeducation camp” created in Hinzert, a
few kilometers north of the Saar border in the Hunsrück, in October
1939.56 Initially inspired by Fritz Todt, general inspector of the Nazi labor
and construction of‹ce called Organization Todt, the camp at Hinzert
became the model for an expanding network of “reeducation” centers,
subsequently initiated by German employers and designed to incarcerate
workers, under brutal conditions, for the “crimes” of absenteeism, slowdowns, lack of productivity, drinking on the job, insubordination, expressions of opposition to the Nazi regime, and actions deemed detrimental to
the successful “prosecution of the war.”57 This effort to terrorize workers
at the Röchling steelworks reached its peak when the ‹rm set up its own
“factory summary court” (Betriebliche Schnellgericht) in April 1943. The
court, which was run by company of‹cials, state “trustees of labor,” and
representatives from the DAF, would “sentence” workers for offenses
related to “idleness at work” (Arbeitsbummelei), after which they were
incarcerated in a factory-owned camp in Etzenhofen. Targeting German
workers and the ever-growing numbers of foreign workers, mostly Eastern
European slave laborers, it represented a privatized form of managerial

216

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

terror, which, according to Röchling, was designed to raise the level of
workplace discipline without losing workers to the camps of the gestapo.58
Finally, Herrmann Röchling ultimately became “one of the most
powerful industrialists” in the corporative structure and war machine of
the Nazi empire.59 A long-standing advocate of imperial expansion, racist
and anti-Semitic nationalism, and German continental hegemony, Röchling was a close ally of Hermann Göring, Reich marshal and head of the
Four-Year Plan Of‹ce after 1936.60 These commitments and connections
led to his appointment as chairman of the Reich Group Industry, District
Group Saarland-Palatinate (Bezirksgruppe Saarland-Pfalz der Reichsgruppe Industrie) and to his later appointment as chairman of the Reich
Iron Association (Reichsvereiningung Eisen), an organization of all iron
and steel ‹rms in Germany. Created in May 1942, the Reich Iron Association was designed as a “national peak cartel” for the purpose of organizing iron and steel production for the regime’s war and expanding continental hegemony and “Greater German Empire.” It took the form of a
corporatist organization responsible for rationalizing and increasing iron
and steel production, promoting technological advancements in the iron
and steel industry, coordinating the allocation of raw materials and the
import and export the industry’s products, overseeing existing cartels, setting prices and regulating disputes among producers, and making determinations over the pro‹tability and viability of iron and steel ‹rms. These
vital functions, according to Röchling, were not to serve an anticapitalist
system of centralized state planning but, rather, were designed to maintain
German capitalism or the “private economy.”61
In this capacity, Röchling in›uenced labor and economic policy
throughout the iron and steel industry of the Third Reich during the war
years. Röchling was thus responsible for ensuring the exercise of terror at
the workplace in the iron and steel industry, including issuing orders to the
member ‹rms of the Reich Iron Association to extend punishment of the
“transgressions” of steelworkers on the shop ›oor “all the way to the concentration camp if necessary”;62 and as chairman, he helped to organize
the economic empire of the Nazi regime as it extended into newly occupied
territories. In July 1942, Röchling was appointed Reich representative for
iron and steel in the occupied territories and took charge of matters related
to economic policy and industrial ownership and concentration in the
newly conquered regions of Europe. His efforts on behalf of the expanding
German empire, especially in the occupied “western regions,” served his
own economic interests (for Röchling had long sought access to the ore

Epilogue

217

‹elds of Lorraine) and the wider economic interests of Nazi regime.63 Consequently, Röchling was put on trial in Rastatt in the French occupation
zone in February 1948 and sentenced by an international tribunal to ten
years in prison for his activities on behalf of the Nazi regime, especially as
“promoter and bene‹ciary” of “slave labor.”64
There was nothing predetermined about Röchling’s path from prewar leader of the Saar and national yellow union movement and representative for Saar heavy industry to Reich representative for iron and steel
during the Third Reich; nor can the history of corporatism be traced in linear fashion from the decade before 1914 to the 1930s and 1940s, for there
were important differences between the emergent corporatist political
project of employers before the First World War and the of‹cially sanctioned architecture of interest organizations, regulatory mechanisms, and
violence of Nazi “corporatism” during the 1940s. Rather, these histories
are best understood as complex genealogies—contingent and “heterogeneous” trajectories that shifted and evolved in relation to other “discourses, practices, and events” from 1900 to 1945.65 Instead of a history of
the continuity of industrial relations, employer politics, and the radical
Right from 1900 to 1945, this genealogical perspective offers analysis of the
conditions of emergence and formation of radical nationalist corporatism.
It suggests that those conditions were produced in a set of wider social and
political transformations after the 1890s: rapid economic and organizational concentration in German domestic heavy industry, the creation of
new forms of state welfare and workplace regulation, the reconstitution of
the forms and domains of Öffentlichkeit, and political struggles over factory paternalism itself, which eroded the foundations of the paternalist
sociopolitical order in the Saar and other parts of Germany. In this context, employers and their representatives responded to the challenges of
bourgeois liberals, Catholic reformers, Christian trade unionists, and
Social Democrats by reorganizing and rearticulating the structures of
work, economic interest organization, and sociopolitical order, in distinctively corporatist ways. This new ideological discourse, which incorporated technocratic and bioracial schemas of workplace management,
aimed self-consciously to restore employer prerogative and the conditions
of capitalist pro‹tability in a “free economy,” which was allegedly threatened by the rise of trade unions, the political Left, and parliamentary
democracy. Max Schlenker carried this corporatist discourse over into the
Weimar era and rearticulated it when he attacked the Weimar Republic on
behalf of Ruhr heavy industry, though his tactical opposition to Hitler’s

218

Work, Race, and the Emergence of Radical Right Corporatism in Imperial Germany

chancellorship cost him his job and in›uence after 1933. In the case of Hermann Röchling, however, long-espoused capitalist labor policies and economic practices, corporatist forms of industrial and social organization,
biological racism, and imperialist ideologies anticipated and were effectively adapted to the industrial order and colonial empire of the Third
Reich.

31. An obvious example in this regard would be the in›uential and allegedly
“moderate” (i.e., non-Nazi) Ruhr industrialist Paul Reusch, chairman of the Langnamverein, who expressed tactical opposition to a Hitler-led government in early
January 1933 but had allied himself with Hitler and the Nazi movement during the
fall of 1931 in the run-up to the presidential elections in the summer of 1932, before
turning back to a Papen-led governing coalition, with Nazi participation, during
the fall and winter of 1932. It was Franz von Papen, of course, who ‹nally orchestrated Hitler’s appointment as chancellor in January 1933. Neebe, Großindustrie,
